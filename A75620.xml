            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining Light;</hi> who by his indefatigable and unwearied ſtudie in the ſublime myſteries of the Goſpel, did ſpend and waſte himſelf to the ſocket and utmost end of his laſt breath, to explicate the darkest places of the ſacred Scriptures; that he might give light to others in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Christ. And though this Piece be a Poſthumus, yet it ſpeaketh the living praiſe of its departed Authour. And cannot but diſcover its ſelfe to be the product
<pb facs="tcp:168769:3"/> of ſo holy and learned a Divine as the Author was. The matter it ſelfe declareth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his worth, and the largeneſſe of his capacity in the right apprehending and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word of truth, to the confuting of hereſies and damnable errors. It may well be ſaid of him, as of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> of old; <hi>Maluit ſedem, quàm fidei ſyllabam mutare,</hi> He had (while he was) rather have loſt whatſoever profits and preferments were caſt upon him, than to have altered or forſaken the leaſt ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Iota of his Chriſtian-faith: who after he had fought a good fight, kept the faith, and finiſhed his courſe with joy, is accepted into glory. Our loſſe, and the Churches depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, became his gain, his advantage. <hi>For the Prophets doe not live for ever.</hi> Zach. 1. 5. which may give us juſt occaſion to wiſh <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> wiſh, <hi>Oh that our heads were full of water, and our eyes fountaines of teares, that we might weep day and night for the Prophets that are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from us.</hi> And, amongſt them, for this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> of whom I may ſay the Poets words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That he was one of a Thouſand. With what diligence, and with
<pb facs="tcp:168769:3"/> what ſtudie and paines, with what good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, with what integrity and uprightneſſe he did carry himſelfe in the conſtant courſe of his life, thoſe that were moſt intimate with him cannot but teſtifie. All that knew any thing of him, knew the truth of all. His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Preaching did ſhew indefatigable great pains and labour, being one of the moſt hard courſes that could be undergone, which was by way of Paraphraſe, and Explication of the moſt myſterious and obſcure Texts of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures. Great dexterity, good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and profound and admirable learning were everywhere manifeſted in his Miniſtry. He was noted in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity for one of prime wit, and ſharp conceipt, plain in the delivery of the word, yet ſo, that any one might diſcern there was both judgement, much learning, and wiſdome mixt therewith. He had a ſoul that aſpired after much more, than ſo weak, and ſickly a body was able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe. He put forth his ſtrength beyond his ſtrength to doe good. Even as a Taper, that doth waſt it ſelf to give light to others; ſo did he exhauſt himſelf, &amp; ſtrengh and vitall parts to give light to all. Nothing made him, for
<pb facs="tcp:168769:4"/> ſome time before his death, to give off his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but weakneſs, &amp; diſability of body. So that he muſt have this teſtimony, that he did ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God, and his Church, as long as God would have him to do ſervice to him on earth. And many have cauſe to weep, though not for him, who is now tranſlated to glory, yet for themſelves in the loſs of ſo faithfull and carefull a diſpencer of the word of God. I dare ſay no more, leſt, while I indeavour to declare his worth, and dignity, I ſhould do him wrong. Had he lived to have ſuperviſed this work, no queſtion but it would have paſſed his hand with more politeneſſe, and authority. I now deſire thee, not only to read, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to weigh, and conſider the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the heavenly matter contained therein; That that God, that cauſeth light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, may cauſe the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt to ſhine in all our hearts more &amp; more to the perfect day: Which at the Throne of grace ſhall be continually prayed for, by him that is,</p>

No tydings in the world ſo good as thoſe that impart Salvation by Chriſt. And that Meſſage was never ſo clearely delivered as under the New Teſtament; though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old it was, but more obſcurely. Therefore though there were Goſpell in the Old Teſtament, yet yee do not find it called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, namely the <hi>Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Paul a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparate to the Goſpell of God.</hi> The four firſt Books of the New Teſtament, becauſe they do moſt lively hold forth to you the Hiſtory of Chriſt's Incarnation, and Converſation, and Paſſion, and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and his Sermons, and Miracles; Therefore they are called peculiarly by this name of <hi>Goſpell.</hi> All the other Books they do but inlarge, and apply, and illuſtrate theſe four <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> Even as all the Prophets under the Old Teſtament, were but as ſo many Commentators upon <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now, if it be lawfull to compare Scripture with Scripture, for ſome kind of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is.

Certainly, glorious things are ſpoken of Thee, Oh Thou Goſpell of God, as he ſaid of the City of God. <hi>Glorious things, &amp;c.</hi> It is called <hi>the Glorious Goſpell of the Bleſſed God.</hi> Such a phraſe you have, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>according to the Glorious Goſpell of the Bleſſed God, which is committed to my truſt.</hi> It is called, elſe where, The Goſpell of the Kingdome. There is no coming to Heaven, but by the Goſpell, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Preaching the Goſpell of the Kingdome.</hi> It is called the Goſpell of Peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>How beautifull are the feet of them that Preach the Goſpell of peace, and bring glad Tydings of good things?</hi> It is called the Goſpell of the Grace of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. <hi>That I might finiſh my Courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpell of the Grace of God.</hi> Would you then have Glory, or Peace, or Grace, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, liſten then to the Goſpell. So much for the Title.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the Writer of this Book, The Pen-man of it; It is <hi>John.</hi> The Goſpell according to <hi>John. Matthew,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> theſe four drew the Chariot in which Chriſt rid all the World over. And amongſt them four, <hi>John</hi> hath a kind of preheminency. The Ancients are wont to compare theſe four, to thoſe four beaſts in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 1. 10.</note> who had the faces of a Man, of an Oxe, of a Lyon, and of an Eagle: and they make <hi>John</hi> the Eagle, becauſe he ſoareth aloft more than all the reſt in the Contemplation of Chriſt's Divinity. The Eagle maketh his Neſt on high, as it is in <hi>Job.</hi> The Eagle can do that, which the other fouls of the aire are not able to do. It can look upon the Sun in its higheſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Behold the Eagle of the Goſpell looking upon Chriſt in his Divine nature, and expreſſing that more then all the other <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> They that are given to Divine ſpeculation, know the flight of this Eagle. You that would be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-minded, liſten to what <hi>John</hi> telleth you. <hi>John</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi>'s Title.</note> 
               <hi>whom the Lord loveth.</hi> That is his Title. <hi>There was leaning on Jeſus Boſome one of his Diſciples, whom Jeſus loved.</hi> The likelier man to reveale ſecrets; who was in the Boſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168769:6"/> of Chriſt. We are wont to communicate our ſecrets to our friends, to thoſe whom we love moſt. You may expect to hear of Chriſts ſecrets from the Diſciple <hi>whom Jeſus loved.</hi> And therefore, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, John</hi> drew out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <note place="margin">Chriſts ſecrets are revealed to his beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones.</note> of Chriſt, the very Heart of Chriſt, what he was about to make known to the World. The King ſendeth a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to you, and by his Favourite; you expect to know the whole mind of the Prince, becauſe his Favourite is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. Here is the Diſciple whom Chriſt loved. And not onely ſo, but <hi>John</hi> the Sonne of Thunder, that is a true Title of his, which onely he and his brethren ſhared in, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 17. <hi>James</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the brother of <hi>James.</hi> He nameth them <hi>Boanerges,</hi> which is, the ſonnes of Thunder, to rowſe men from ſecurity. Here is Thunder in the Goſpell. So many Words, ſo many Thunder-Claps. <hi>John</hi> was now to deal with deſperate Heretiques, That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Divinity of Chriſt; and here is Thunder for them, enough to affright them all. <hi>Junius</hi> was not able to ſtand <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Junius</hi> how converted.</note> before the force of this Thunder-clap. He himſelfe telleth us, That in his youth he was given to Atheiſm, and drowned in Curſed principles; and the firſt thing that brought him to the Knowledge of a God, was the beginning of this Chapter of <hi>John;</hi> He caſt his eyes upon theſe words, and profeſſed, that he was not himſelfe of a long time after; he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w ſo much Majeſty therein beyond all humane Rhetorick, that he was not himſelfe of a long time after. This, <hi>Junius</hi> (that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Bible) ſpeaketh of himſelfe. There is a miſtake amongſt people, as if there were no powerfull preaching, but that which is Clamorous preaching. As if the goodneſſe of a mans Sermon were to be made out of the goodneſſe of his Longues, and not out of the matter; by the goodneſſe of the delivery, and not by the ſublimity of the Doctrine. Here is <hi>John,</hi> the meekeſt of the Diſciples, the moſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple of them all, a Man of a meek ſpirit, as we read in his Story, yet this <hi>John</hi> hath ſomething of Thunder in him. How? By the effect of his Doctrine, not by the height of his voyce. As it is ſaid of <hi>Pericles,</hi> a great and famous Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in <hi>Athens;</hi> He Thundered, and ratled in his ſpeech. And ſo <hi>John</hi> in his Doctrine; the ſonne of Thunder in that reſpect.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168769:6"/>
            <p> Thirdly, you muſt Conſider the <hi>occaſion of</hi> John's <hi>writing this Goſpell.</hi> When the Paſtor was abſent, the Wolves broke in upon the Flock. When <hi>John</hi> was baniſhed into <hi>Patmos</hi> by <hi>Domitian, Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticks <note place="margin">The reaſons why the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Iohn</hi> was written.</note> there were, that denied the Divinity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and this occaſioned <hi>John,</hi> as they ſay, to write this Goſpell, wherein he aſſerteth the Godhead of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And ſo, by the way, occaſionally yee ſee what uſe even He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticks are made of to the Church of God. We had loſt this Goſpell, if <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> had not broached their hereſies. God ſuffereth deſperate opinions to be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the purging of his owne Truth. The Truth of God is compared to Silver. <hi>The words of the Lord are pure, yea, as Silver tried in a furnace of Earth, purified ſeven times.</hi> Every corrupt opinion that cometh to be vented againſt any Truth of God, that is a new furnace; and the truth being caſt into that furnace, it cometh out the purer for it. <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſeven times.</hi> As it is with Paſſengers of quality and note, were it not for ſome evill inveterate Currs in the ſtreet, they might paſſe, and never be obſerved; the very barking of the Dogs maketh them to be noted. So theſe evill inveterate Corrupt Hereticks, by their barking, have occaſioned the taking notice of that truth of the Divinity of Chriſt. Had not they barked, <hi>John</hi> had not Written. This was the occaſion. And this ſhould incourage you to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe the ſame Hereticks are with us now: we have our owne <hi>Ebions,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthuſſes</hi> to this day, that deny the Divinity of Chriſt, and ſay, He had no being till he took it from the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, we come to the <hi>Scope</hi> of this Book, which is to hold out the Divine nature of Chriſt, as the object of our Faith, to ſet forth Chriſt as the Sonne of God, that we believe in Him, ſo, as to have Salvation by Him. And This St. <hi>John</hi> telleth you, to have been his aime, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. <hi>Theſe are written, that you might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Sonne of God, and that believing you might have Life through Him.</hi> He deſires to ſet forth Chriſt to us as our Redeemer, and therefore laboureth ſo much, both in the beginning of his Goſpell, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168769:7"/> to hold forth the Godhead, and Divine nature of Chriſt, That ſo it might appear that he is a ſufficient <hi>Redeemer.</hi> If He had not been God, He could not have gon through with the purchaſe. As the Eagle trieth her young ones, by holding them againſt the beams of the Sun; and, if they be able to look upon them with a ſtedfaſt eye, ſhe owneth ſuch: So <hi>John</hi> bringeth his Readers to the Sun of the Divinity of Chriſt, and ſuch as will not acknowledge that, are baſtard-Chriſtians, and not Saints.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, One thing yet remaineth, by way of preface; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which is the difference between this and the other Goſpells: which lieth eſpecially in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whereas the three former <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> inſiſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially upon things done by Chriſt, after <hi>John</hi> was caſt into Priſon; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſo principally relate the acts of Chriſt, in the laſt year of his Miniſtry: St. <hi>John</hi> taketh in here the acts of his two former years: what Chriſt did, and what Chriſt ſaid, before <hi>John</hi> was caſt into Priſon: which the other touch but ſparingly upon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> inſiſt mainly upon what Chriſt did; <hi>Saint John</hi> relateth eſpecially what Chriſt ſaid. They are much more large in recording his Miracles, <hi>John</hi> in recording his Sermons, and Prayers, as Chap. 15. Some Miracles indeed he relateth to us, but they are ſuch, as wake may either for his Diſcourſe with the Diſciples, or for his diſputation with his Adverſaries. So ſtill he ſeemed more to take notice of what Chriſt ſaid, then what he did.</p>
            <p>I now prepare you to be attentive: for I begin to cloſe with the firſt Chapter, and with theſe firſt words of the Chapter, which are of ſo great importance, That, as I told you before, they had a moſt extraordinary force upon <hi>Junius</hi> his ſpirit; and beſides, upon one <hi>Numenius,</hi> a Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. That falling upon this Goſpell, cried out in a kind of indignation, This <hi>Barbarian,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>(for ſo the Greeks call the Jews)</hi> hath concluded more in a few lines, than our great Philoſophers have in all their Books; He was ſo taken with the myſtery of theſe words! For they are words which the moſt quick-ſighted Chriſtian can be hardly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168769:7"/> able to ſee through. And throughout, I ſhall indeavour to make it as plain, as God ſhall inable me. Onely ye muſt not take it amiſſe, if ſome things ſhall be left obſcure. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will not defraud thoſe that are able to underſtand, for fear of being irksome, to them, that are not able.</hi> Do but think your ſelves at a feaſt. When many gueſts are invited to a feaſt, They are of ſeverall Conſtitutions, and like ſeverall diſhes. But now, Shall a man that ſeeth ſuch a diſh before him, to which he hath no ſtomack, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently riſe from the Table? No, he will perhaps think with himſelfe, Other men may like this diſh: So it ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here. Suppoſe ſomething be too hard for thee, it may perhaps be clear to another. <hi>Paul</hi> is a debtor to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe; therefore let none ariſe and goe away, but let every man expect his portion. Do you hope, that whatſoever difficult paſſages there are in the Scriptures, yet there will be ſome full of Light and Comfort. To cloſe then, with the firſt verſe.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>John the Divine.</hi> (A word too much ſcorned now a daies) <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. He is called <hi>Divine,</hi> becauſe he held forth the Divinity of the <hi>Word,</hi> namely of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Others did it as well as He. But not ſo much. Ye ſhall find <hi>Luke</hi> calling Chriſt the <hi>Word</hi> in that place, though not often, yet worthy your noting, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eye witneſſes, and Miniſters of the Word.</hi> What is that? not Preachers of the Goſpell, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>followers of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> had that relation from the Apoſtles themſelves, who were eye-witneſſes of Chriſt; and from the Seventy Diſciples, who were likewiſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the <hi>Word.</hi> And, in all reaſon, this muſt be the ſenſe, that, by <hi>Word</hi> here, <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould mean the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it ſuiteth ſo well, with what the other Apoſtles ſaid. As <hi>John</hi> begins his Epiſtle. He telleth them, he would ſpeak to them, of whom they had heard and ſeen, of the <hi>Word</hi> of Life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, and ſeen with our eyes, and have look't upon, and have handled, of the Word of Life.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> telleth them, he ſpake what he received <note place="margin">By Luke.</note> from the Miniſters of the <hi>Word.</hi> Which ſuiteth with that place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of Jeſus Chriſt, but we were eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this be not the meaning, then conſider, How much wanting doth <hi>Luke</hi> ſeem to be to his Readers. He inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:168769:8"/> to write of Jeſus Chriſt, and to make a Preface of Chriſt, and fully mentioneth him whom he intendeth to write upon. Ye ſhall find <hi>Paul</hi> calling Chriſt the <hi>VVord,</hi> in that fare-well-ſpeech of his to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">By <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> which is recommended, Act. 20. 32. <hi>Now, brethren, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God, and to the VVord of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified.</hi> I know, this place is commonly interpreted of the Goſpell; and, that the Goſpell is called the <hi>VVord</hi> of Grace, in another place of the Acts of the Apoſtles: but yet, they queſtion, whether that be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here or no; and that upon this ground, becauſe that <hi>Word</hi> is here meant, to which the Saints are commended. Now, the Goſpell is commended to the Saints, but the Saints are not commended to the Goſpell. But, ſome other Word is here meant, that is, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I commend you to God, namely, to God the Father; and to the <hi>VVord,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Chriſt. Indeed, for the Goſpell to be commended to the Saints, is an uſuall thing; 2 Tim. 1. 13, 14. <hi>Hold faſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Uſuall for the Goſpel to be commended to the Saints, not the Saints to the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>the form of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love, which is in Jeſus Chriſt. That good thing which was committed to thee, keep by the holy Ghoſt, which dwelleth in us.</hi> And ſo, in the ſecond Chapter of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, verſ. 2. <hi>The things that thou haſt heard of me amongſt many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithfull men.</hi> Here is the Goſpell committed to the Saints. But where do you find the Saints committed to the Goſpell? To God, ye find them committed again and again: Act. 4. 26. <hi>Having commended them to the grace of God.</hi> Here are men commended to God. And ſo in that ſenſe I take it here. I commend you to God, and to the <hi>Word</hi> of his grace, to Jeſus Chriſt, who is called, <hi>The VVord of his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt the Author of Grace, and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God.</note> 
                  <hi>grace,</hi> here; becauſe it is Chriſt, that God is reconciled to us by. He is the Author of all that grace, and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and favour, which we have with God. So underſtand the <hi>VVord of grace,</hi> as you underſtand the <hi>VVord of life,</hi> that is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> clearly: <hi>VVhat we have heard and ſeen, of the VVord of life;</hi> that is, Chriſt, the Author of that. Ye ſhall find <hi>Paul</hi> calling Chriſt by the name of the <hi>VVord,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:168769:9"/> in another place, which is commonly otherwiſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Heb. 4. 12. <hi>The word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of him, with whom we have to do.</hi> The <hi>VVord,</hi> clearly, here is a Perſon; I ſay, a Perſon: for, the <hi>VVord</hi> of God is quick. All things are manifeſt in <hi>His</hi> ſight. All things are naked, and open in the eyes of <hi>Him. He,</hi> and <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>His;</hi> theſe imply, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a Perſon: not of the Word revealed, but of the <hi>Eſſentiall vord</hi> of God, which is <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Not but that ſomething may agree to the revealed Word, becauſe it hath the ſtamp of Chriſt upon it; but ſomething cannot be given to it. The Word is a Revealer of the thoughts of the heart, when it is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Preached. But, Who can properly ſay of the <hi>word,</hi> that every creature is naked and open before <hi>the word of God.</hi> Before Chriſt, every creature is open. Chriſt is called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>with God, no word ſhall be impoſſible.</hi> So in the Originall. There is nothing that God hath ſpoken, but it ſhall come to paſſe. Ye have a very clear place for that, Matth. 4. 4. <hi>Man doth not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the mouth of God.</hi> As I take it, the moſt proper meaning of that place is. By <hi>every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> we underſtand, every <hi>creature</hi> which God hath ordained for food. And ye will be of that mind, too if you ſee Deuter. 8. 3. <hi>He humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with Manna, which thou kneweſt not, nor thy fathers before thee; that he might make thee know, that man doth not live by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Whatſoever the word of God maketh food, whatſoever God appointeth to be inſtrumentall, as he did <hi>Manna</hi> here; There is <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum reale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, <hi>verbum orale,</hi> the <hi>word uttering,</hi> is the expreſſion by which that thing is delivered. That is the end, why God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:168769:11"/> hath given us ſpeech. If we were to deal onely with God, we ſhould need no tongue or ſpeech, becauſe God knoweth the thoughts of our hearts. If we were to deal onely with our ſelves, we ſhould need no ſpeech; for every man knoweth <note place="margin">Why the uſe of Speech is given to man.</note> what himſelf thinketh. But becauſe we are to deal one with another, therefore God giveth us the uſe of ſpeech, that there might be a word <hi>uttering</hi> and <hi>declaring</hi> to one another, what one another thinks, Pſal. 139. 4. <hi>There is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Chriſt is therefore called the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe he reſembleth all theſe. He reſembleth the <hi>word conceived,</hi> as being the expreſſe Image of his Father's Perſon; even as our conceptions are the image of our minds.</p>
               <p>Again. He reſembleth the <hi>word uttered,</hi> as being that Thing, which is the very ſuhſtance of all his Father's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Promiſes.</p>
               <p>And again. He reſembleth the <hi>word uttering,,</hi> as being the <hi>Interpreter</hi> of his Father's will, in all Ages. In all theſe three reſpects, Chriſt is called the <hi>word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, in reference to a <hi>word conceived.</hi> Look as the word conceived in the mind, is the image of the mind, or <note place="margin">1. Chriſt is the <hi>Word concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Father's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> conception, or notion; it repreſenteth our underſtanding to the ful: So, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, He is the Image, <hi>the expreſs Image of his Father's Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. therefore his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>word.</hi> There is no ſuch repreſentation of a man, as his conception. No ſuch repreſentation of God, as Chriſt, the expreſſe image of his Father's Perſon. Mark that, I pray you. There is a great deal of difference to be put between a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> a <hi>Picture,</hi> and a <hi>Statue.</hi> A <hi>Statue,</hi> to which this expreſſion ſeemeth to refer. <hi>He is the engraven image of his Father's Perſon.</hi> A <hi>Shadow,</hi> that is a kind of a ſleight repreſentation of a body, but not a clear one; and ſuch a repreſentation of God is all the Creatures. We ſee ſomething of God even in the Graſſe and Trees, and Beaſts of the field. A <hi>Picture,</hi> that repreſenteth him a great deal more lively than a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow can; it hath uſually a man's feature and complexion, which a Shadow hath not. And there is a kind of <hi>Picture</hi> of God, drawn upon the Souls of Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>But there is a further repreſentation than either of theſe,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168769:11"/> that is, in a <hi>Statue:</hi> A Character that repreſenteth further than a Picture; a Picture may ſhew but half the face, or half the body, to the middle; but a <hi>Statue,</hi> that repreſents the whole man, <hi>Cap à pe,</hi> from top to toe. Whereas a Picture; (though you may have one drawn more fully, yet) is, for the moſt part, ſo framed, as to repreſent, though the whole body, yet not in its full proportion; not the limbs ſo big as in a living man. That alſo <hi>Statues</hi> have above <hi>Pictures,</hi> they repreſent not onely the ſhape, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of every limb: Chriſt is the Character of his Father's Perſon. Thus he doth not onely hold forth God, but whole God, altogether. Chriſt is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> as the Father; and <hi>Omni-preſent,</hi> as the Father; and <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> as the Father. And thus be is fitly called the <hi>Word,</hi> in reference to the <hi>word conceived,</hi> as being the expreſſe Image of his Father's Perſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reference to the <hi>word uttering,</hi> to the <note place="margin">2. Chriſt, the <hi>VVord uttering,</hi> as the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his Father's will.</note> 
                  <hi>verbum orale;</hi> becauſe Chriſt is the Interpreter of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will. Look, as we expreſſe our ſelves one to another, by our words; ſo God, in all Ages; hath expreſſed himſelf to the world, by his Son. The great <hi>Interpreter</hi> of His will, in all Ages, hath been Chriſt. Matth. 11. 27. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> God; that dwelleth in the light inacceſſible, had been for ever hidden to the eye of the world, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had not been the <hi>word</hi> to reveal him. Joh. 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, but the onely begotten Son in the boſom of the Father; he hath declared him.</hi> All the knowledge we have of God in the world, we may thank Chriſt for it; <hi>He hath declared him.</hi> We ſhould never know one another's minds, if we had not the uſe of ſpeech to declare our ſelves. Chriſt is the word, by which God declareth himſelf to man. He it was, that was the <hi>word</hi> uttering. The firſt Promiſe that ever was, that which was made to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, <hi>The</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpent's head.</hi> He it was that delivered the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that ſpake by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168769:12"/> Prophets, and in them; 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11. <hi>Of which ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Prophets have enquired and ſearched diligently, who propheſied of the grace that ſhould come unto you; ſearching what, and what manner of time, the Spirit of Chriſt, which was in them, did ſignifie, &amp;c.</hi> It was the Spirit of Chriſt in the Prophets, that ſignified whatſoever they foretold. And ſo in the Apoſtles after them, Chriſt was the Speaker in them: 2 Cor. 13. 3. <hi>Ye ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt the Church's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour to God, and God's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour to the Church:</note> 
                  <hi>in you.</hi> This <hi>word</hi> in the Text, as it is the Church's Orator to God, ſo he is God's Orator to the Church. He ſpeaketh to God for the Church, and to that end he ſitteth in Heaven, at the right hand of God, interceding for us. And he ſpeaks from God to the Church, and in all Ages hath made known the will of the Father. And ſo reſembleth <hi>the word uttering.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt is reſembled by the <hi>word uttering,</hi> the <hi>verbum orale,</hi> as being the ſubſtance of all his Father's Revelations and Promiſes; the ſum of all that God hath uttered, ſince the beginning of the world, and the Product, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of all God's Revelations. What was the thing promiſed to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe? <hi>The ſeed of the woman.</hi> What to <hi>Abraham?</hi> Chriſt, who was the ſeed, <hi>in whom all nations ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> All the Types of the Ceremonial Law, What was the ſubſtance of them? Chriſt. Indeed, the Ceremonial Law was the Jews Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. <note place="margin">Chriſt the Subſtance of all God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</note> Every thing pointed to Chriſt, the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of all thoſe Revelations of God. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe.</hi> The Prophets and the Law both. It is the ſpeech of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> Joh. 1. 45. <hi>We have found him, of whom Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Law, and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> The ſum of all Divinity is the Scripture, the ſum of the Scripture is the Goſpell, the ſum of the Goſpell is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He is the <hi>word uttering</hi> in all. What is the world, but God unfolded? What is the Scriptures, but Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded? As the Prince of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> one of that Houſe; a Prince, and yet a Preacher by Profeſſion: It is ſaid to be his expreſſion, <hi>Scripturae ſunt faciae, in quibus involutus eſt puer Jeſus:</hi> All the Scriptures are but ſwadling-clothes,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:168769:12"/> in which <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Child <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is wrapped up.</p>
               <p>So he is likewiſe reſembled by the <hi>word uttering,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance of all his Father's Revelations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. For, <hi>in him</hi> (Chriſt), <hi>all the promiſes are Yea and Amen,</hi> 2. Cor. 1. 20. This for Explication of that term, [The <hi>Word,]</hi> which ye have twice in this Verſe.</p>
               <p>Let us now Apply it, before we come to any of the Predicates.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In that Chriſt is here called the <hi>Word,</hi> in reference <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> to the word conceived, as being the expreſſe Image of his Father's Perſon; as our thoughts are the image of the mind: Let us learn from hence,</p>
               <p>Firſt, to be helped here, to underſtand ſomething of that Eternall Generation, What the Son of God is, who, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is inexpreſſible: <hi>Who can declare his generation?</hi> Iſa. 3. This may help us to conceive better of it, than any expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the world. When we compare Chriſt with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our own hearts; there is nothing commeth ſo near the nature of that eternall generation of the Son of God. The underſtanding that conceiveth a notion, without difficulty, without paſſion, without agitation and ſtirring. There is no conception, no proceſſion of any thing, ſo pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>inconcrete,</hi> and <hi>ſimple,</hi> and <hi>unmixt,</hi> as the proceeding of the thoughts of our Underſtanding. Such is the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Son from the Father; at leaſt, this, of all things we can take into our imagination, is the fitteſt to expreſſe Him. And indeed, if it were poſſible for a man to contract all his notions into one; mark it, if it were poſſible for him to conceive at once, whatſoever he apprehendeth; then that Conceit, that he conceiveth in his underſtanding, it would be that man's <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and that man's truth, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth whatſoever he hath in his heart. Such a <hi>word</hi> is Chriſt, in reference to his Father: Whatſoever there is in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of wiſdom, it is expreſſed there; whatſoever excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is in God, it is in the Son. Thence it is, that Chriſt is <note place="margin">Chriſt, both Wiſdom and Truth.</note> ſo frequently called <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and ſet forth by that name, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. And he is called <hi>Truth, I am the way, and the truth, and the life.</hi> And there would be the whole of a man's wiſdom in that notion, which will contain all his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:168769:13"/> at once. So it is in Chriſt, which is the wiſdom of his Father. That is one thing. It may help us ſomething in conceiving, the unconceivable and unexpreſſible Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son from the Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may help us to conceive of the <hi>Father,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we read of the <hi>Son;</hi> and to conceive of the <hi>Son,</hi> according to what we read of the <hi>Father;</hi> becauſe the Son is the expreſſe Image of the Father's Perſon. Therefore it is of great uſe for poor penitent ſinners, that, with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, ſtand afar off, and dare not lift up their eyes to Heaven. For howſoever they conceive ſome hope in regard of Chriſt, yet they are affraid, God the Father will never pardon them. They look at Chriſt, as a Saviour all of Bowells. Many poor ſouls have ſtrange apprehenſions of God the Father, as if he were altogether a conſuming fire, therefore no pardon to be expected from him. But here is for thy comfort: Chriſt, <note place="margin">Comfort to penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> whatſoever he is, is the expreſſe Image of the Father's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; therefore, what thou findeſt in Chriſt, thou maiſt find in the Father. Was Chriſt ſo full and free-hearted, as to be ready to help every poor ſoul, in the daies of his fleſh? He is but the Father's Image, and thou maiſt find the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Father. Thou maiſt go to God, as to Chriſt if he were here in the fleſh. On the other ſide, If any man <note place="margin">Terrour to ſtubborn ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> be a ſtubborn and preſumptuous ſinner, that dareth go on to walk in the luſt of his eyes, and pride of his heart, and flatter himſelf with theſe thoughts, [Lord have mercy upon me, will ſave him on his death-bed: Howſoever there may be ſome rigour expected from the Father; why, Chriſt will have mercy upon him, Chriſt dyed for him, and will ſave him: And he needeth make no queſtion of the love of Chriſt, of his affection, and readineſſe to help him, though he walketh in the ſtubbornneſſe of his wicked heart:] Let ſuch a one know, That God, as he will by no means clear the guilty, ſo nor will Chriſt too. Mark that place for this, Exod. 23. 20. <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith God there) <hi>I ſend an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</hi> That Angel was <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for it is ſaid, that they provoked <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Wilderneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now mark, <hi>Beware of him, and obey</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:168769:13"/> 
                  <hi>his voyce; provoke him not, for he will not pardon your tranſgreſſions.</hi> Why? <hi>for my name is in him.</hi> Chriſt is juſt as I am, ſaith God the Father here, and as ſevere to ſinners as I am: Therefore provoke him not, he will not pardon. <hi>Kiſſe the Son, leſt he be angry.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> can be angry as well as the <hi>Father.</hi> Though he be the Lamb of God, yet that Lamb will turn Lion againſt them that diſobey him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to obey the Goſpell of Chriſt. The Lamb will be ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, as to make <hi>the great ones of the earth to cry, Who ſhall deliver them from the wrath of the Lamb?</hi> Rev. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In that Chriſt is called the <hi>Word,</hi> in reference <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to the <hi>word uttering,</hi> becauſe he is the Interpreter of his Father's will, and declareth the Father's mind to the ſons of men: Let us learn from hence to bleſſe Chriſt; for all the knowledge we have of God, and the things of God, it is from him we have it, he is the Word that hath declared it: <hi>The onely begotten Son in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him,</hi> Joh. 1. 18. If men think themſelves ſo much beholding to their Tutors, and School-maſters, that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to them the hidden things of Arts and Sciences; If <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo much bound to his Maſter, his School-maſter, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his Inſtructor; that he made a queſtion, Whether he were more bound to him, for his teaching of him, than to <hi>Philip</hi> his father for begetting of him: Then, what do we owe to Jeſus Chriſt, the great <hi>Tutor,</hi> to whom we owe all our Learning, <hi>Tutors,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> too? for all Relations meet in him, and all Duty is due to him. And if He be the <hi>word uttering,</hi> let none be aſhamed of that work of the Miniſtry. Some Gentlemen think it ſcorn to make their ſons Miniſters; God the Father made his Son a Miniſter, ye ſee; and ſetteth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his onely Son, to be a revealer of his will to the ſons of men. And if ſo, ſomething elſe may be learned from it.</p>
               <p>Let us all take heed to what we hear. It is Chriſt that is the <hi>word uttering.</hi> What we find in Scripture, and hear delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the Scripture, it is the word of Chriſt: <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The power of the Word Preached.</note> Col. 3. 16. Ye muſt give me leave to tell you, when men ſpeak Scripture to you, rightly interpreted, and ye refuſe to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:168769:14"/> hear; ye do not refuſe men, that ſpeak from the Pulpit, but him that ſpeaketh from Heaven, which is Chriſt himſelf; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we read, Heb. 12. 25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh. For if they eſcaped not, who refuſed him that ſpake on earth; much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaketh from Heaven in every Sermon, wherein truth is delivered unto you. He ſaith to the drunkard from Heaven, Become ſober; and to the wanton he ſaith from Heaven, Become chaſte; to the unbeliever, Lay hold on Chriſt. It is ſaid from Heaven, when it is ſaid from the Pulpit. If men will go on in ſin in ſpight of Heaven, God will confound them in ſpight of the world; they muſt to Hell in ſpight of the world: <hi>Though hand joyn in hand, they ſhall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi> If men will not hear him ſpeak on earth, they muſt not expect to have him to hear, when they would have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That is the third thing. Chriſt is called the <hi>word,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>word uttering;</hi> becauſe he is the ſubſtance of all his Father's Revelations and Promiſes.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore learn from hence, to grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what we read, and whatſoever we hear from the word of God, becauſe he is the ſubſtance of all. Thus, take any Scripture, gage it, and you will find Chriſt in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it: If it be a Precept, it leadeth you to Chriſt for ſtrength to perform it: If it be a Threat, it leadeth you to Chriſt for grace to eſcape it: If it be a Promiſe, it clearly conveyeth Chriſt; <hi>In him all the promiſes are Yea and Amen,</hi> and therefore called, <hi>Pretious promiſes;</hi> not that they have any more price in them, of themſelves, than any other Truths have; but <hi>pretious promiſes.</hi> That is a pretious Box, that hath a rich Jewell in it. Every Promiſe is pretious, that hath Chriſt in more latitude, than other places of Scripture have. Therefore let us labour to find Chriſt in every one. The old World had but one Promiſe, for a great many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we read but of one Promiſe which God made to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; and yet <hi>Adam</hi> a holy man, and <hi>Enoch</hi> a holy man; and yet but one Promiſe. Now, we that have ſo many Promiſes, cannot we find Chriſt in ſome of them to rely upon? <hi>Having therefore theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:168769:14"/> 
                  <hi>dearly Beloved, let us cleanſe our ſelves.</hi> Let us ſeek for Chriſt, and Cleanſing, in the Promiſes. I have done now with the Subject of theſe three Propoſitions, The <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing that is predicated of the Word, is, that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Propoſiti∣on. </seg>1</label> which we meet with in the firſt Propoſition, namely, His eternall <hi>Exiſtency, In the beginning was the word.</hi> The other Evangeliſts, eſpecially <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> they have ſpoken fully of the temporall Generation of Chriſt. So <hi>Matthew</hi> beginneth, <hi>The book of the generation of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſon of David, the ſon of Abraham.</hi> Now <hi>John,</hi> whoſe aim was to inſiſt upon thoſe things, that concern the Divinity of Chriſt, he beginneth with his Eternall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>

                     <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>was,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> theſe two terms are like two Anchors, which the ſhip of a man's ſoul may ſafely ride at, come what ſtorms will come.

The beginning of the Creation that God created, is the ſame that <hi>Moſes</hi> meaneth, Gen. 1. 1. <hi>In the beginning God created heaven and earth.</hi> It is ſomething remarkable, that <hi>Moſes,</hi> with whom God ſpake face to face; and <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, who lay in Chriſt's boſome, ſhould both of them have one <hi>Exordium; In the beginning,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes;</hi> and, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> ſaith <hi>John.</hi> It is thought, that <hi>John</hi> doth allude to <hi>Moſes,</hi> onely with this clear difference; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the Creation of the World, ſaith, <hi>In</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:168769:15"/> 
                     <hi>the beginning, God made heaven and earth.</hi> He ſpeaks of a World that was made. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of a Word that was not made, ſaith, <hi>In the beginning was the word.</hi> He doth not ſay, He was made, as if Chriſt were a creature; but, when all other creatures were made, Chriſt was. Chriſt had a Beeing, when they did but begin to be; therefore he was before them. That which was in the beginning muſt needs be eternall; Why? Why, becauſe, before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures began to be, there was nothing but God.</p>
                  <p>What was before the Beginning? Let that be the queſtion. <label type="milestone">

                     </label> be before the Creation. Here Faith may enter into the darkneſſe of Eternity, where it may loſe it ſelf, and can ſee nothing, but <hi>God before all,</hi> and <hi>God after all,</hi> and <hi>God in all.</hi> Before the Creation, nothing but God. Chriſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creation; when they began to be, he was. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was Eternall, there was no beginning before that Indeed, there was God before the Creation, but God hath no beginning. Though there be <hi>principium ordinis,</hi> there is not <hi>principium temporis;</hi> as, the Father firſt, and <note place="margin">The Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> Son ſecondly, and the holy Ghoſt the third. Here is <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium ordinis,</hi> Order; but no Time, wherein the Father, Son, or holy Ghoſt began to be. So, Chriſt was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, had a beeing then. There was no beginning till the Creation, Therefore Chriſt was from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>This may be confirmed with more ſtrength, becauſe the holy Ghoſt, throughout the Scripture, when he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Eternity, uſeth to do it thus; Such a thing <hi>was before the world;</hi> that is, it was <hi>Eternall.</hi> Pſal. 90. 1, 2. <hi>Lord, thou haſt been our dwelling place in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the earth or the world, from everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi> How proveth he that? Becauſe he was, before the Mountains or Earth was made. Chriſt was before the world, therefore God from everlaſting to everlaſting. Joh. 17. 5. <hi>Now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> That is, from <hi>Eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Take a clear place (for thoſe that clearly apprehend Chriſt to be meant by Wiſdom,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168769:15"/> as undoubtedly He is) <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22. and ſo forward to the 30 verſe; a place, to which our <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> is thought to have alluded here, and it is fully parallel; where Wiſdom ſaith, <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his waies:</hi> Juſt as in the Text, <hi>In the beginning was the word. The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his waies, before his works of old. I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or ever the world was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with water. Before the mountains were ſetled, before the hills were brought forth, &amp;c.</hi> Another teſtimony ye have of Chriſt's Eternity: it is in the Type of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> Heb. 7. 2, 3. <hi>King of Righteouſneſſe, and King of Salem, which is King of Peace. Without father or mother, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcent; having neither beginning of daies, nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, which abideth a Prieſt continually.</hi> What cauſe have we to adore, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh (not onely to admire, but to adore) the fulneſſe of the Scriptures? The very ſilence of the Scriptures ſpeaks deep Myſteries. The Apoſtle arguing from the Scriptures the Eternity of Chriſt, ſpeaketh nothing of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>'s father or mother. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the Worthies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he is wont to ſpeak of their parentage, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and when they dyed. But the Apoſtle, when he ſpeaks of this Prieſt, ſaith, He was without father or mother. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, of the Eternity of Chriſt, ye have, <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. where he ſpeaketh both of the temporall and eternall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son of God; <hi>Thou Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little amongſt the thouſands of Judah, yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that ſhall be Ruler in Iſrael:</hi> Out of thee ſhall he come forth. That is, of his temporall Government. Here he ſpeaketh of his eternall Generation, <hi>Whoſe goings forth have been from everlaſting. In the beginning was the word.</hi> That is, Chriſt was from everlaſting. He had a beeing, before the greateſt began to be. And this may ſerve briefly, for the Explication of that Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the Application, becauſe I intend to be as brief as may be. What ye have heard of Chriſt's Eternity,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:168769:16"/> of having a being before the creatures were made, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you,</p>

Shall the Creatures, which are but of yeſterday? What can they do, to undo, what the eternall God hath ordained before the world was? That is the foundation of all, Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in Chriſt, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him, in love.</hi> Our ſalvation beareth date be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was; therefore there is nothing in the world ſhall prejudice it, much leſſe overthrow it. It reſteth upon him who was in the beginning, and who will be after the end; upon him, who is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega;</hi> more antient than the beginning, and more laſting than the end of the creatures. Alas, poor creatures! time was, when they were not, but then was He, <hi>In the beginning was the word;</hi> and there will come a time when they ſhall not be; but no time, wherein it can be ſaid, Chriſt is not. The Devill is a creature, Shall he be able to undo, what the Eternall hath appointed? He was not when Chriſt was; and though he ſhall now live for ever to be in torment, yet the time ſhall come, when he ſhall not be a Tempter. Then Chriſt ſhall be a Saviour, be ſure. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 12. See what a ſpring of conſolation doth ariſe from this conſideration of <note place="margin">Strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> Chriſt's Eternity; <hi>Art thou not from everlaſting, O Lord my God, my holy One, art thou not from everlaſting? we ſhall not die.</hi> Certainly, we that have an everlaſting Saviour, ſhall be freed from everlaſting death, <hi>we ſhall not die.</hi> This is the lot of as many, as lay hold on him by faith. Our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Saviour loveth to do all things like himſelf. Leſt you ſhould fear either want of love or might, both his love and power are eternall, even as Himſelf is. He hath everlaſting kindneſſe in him, and intendeth to ſhew it unto us, Iſa. 54. 8.

It is a great comfort, when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to die, to think, Whom my Salvation dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; why, upon an everlaſting Redeemer, that dyeth not.</p>
                  <p>There is a time when we muſt go out from all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and have no more to do with thoſe things, that are ſo pleaſing to us in the world. There is a time when we muſt go into Eternity; and there is Chriſt. The creatures we delighted in, they remain not; I, but the God we go to, He remaineth; <hi>From everlaſting to everlaſting, thou art God.</hi> Here is a living Comfort for a dying Creature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is matter of Duty, as well as matter of <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label>
                     <note place="margin">Of Duty.</note> Comfort. If Chriſt were in the beginning, before all the creatures, then let him not come after any of them in our eſteems. That is one Leſſon we learn from hence. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid of Chriſt, Col. 1. 17. <hi>He is hefore all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</hi> He is before all things, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his own beeing: Let him be before all things, and above all things, in our eſteem. He was before all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, O let him not come after them in our hearts. <hi>In the beginning was the word,</hi> when no wealth, no profit, no pleaſure, no preferment, ſuch as men now dote upon. Chriſt is before all theſe things, Why ſhould he go after them in the eſteem of men?</p>
                  <p>As it was amongſt the Heathens, they placed their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the exerciſe of <hi>vertue;</hi> and yet ſome of them cryed, <hi>Virtus poſt nummos, quaerenda pecunia primùm.</hi> Let <note place="margin">

                     </note> vertue come after wealth. They firſt laboured to get a good eſtate, and then look'd after good qualities and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So it is with many Chriſtians, who, in their Doctrins and Profeſſions, place their happineſſe and fellowſhip with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168769:17"/> Chriſt after riches; let Chriſt come after. Which of us doth not wonder, and cry ſhame of the Gadarenes, that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſwine before Chriſt, rather let him go out of their coaſts, than part with their heards. Certainly, we, in effect, do the ſame, when we prefer our ſwiniſh luſts, before the embracing of, and yielding obedience to, our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. We are ready to defie the Jewes for crying, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas;</hi> and yet our actions cry as loud, Not <hi>Him,</hi> but the <hi>world;</hi> not <hi>Him,</hi> but the <hi>fleſh.</hi> Rather imitate good <hi>Tremelius,</hi> who was himſelf a Jew born: and after, when he turned Chriſtian, in reference to what his Country-men, the Jews, had once ſaid, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas;</hi> he made this his Motto, <hi>Non Barabbam, ſed Chriſtum;</hi> Not <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi>

                        <hi>Tremelius</hi> his Motto, after his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to intimate, his having renounced all, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Let it be thine: Not the <hi>world,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> not the <hi>creature,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> not the <hi>fleſh,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He was before all, and ſhall be before all in my eſteem. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi> Pſal. 73. 25. That is one Duty we are to learn from hence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Seeing Chriſt is Eternall, truſt him for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things; expect ſuch from him, that is an everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. Do you think, an everlaſting Father will lay up none but temporall bleſſings for his children? He that was from the beginning, hath provided ſomething that ſhall be after the end, for everlaſting for you, if ye will ſeek after him. Remember what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 Cor. 4. ult. <hi>While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen; for the things which are ſeen are temporall, but the things which are not ſeen are eternall.</hi> Oh! look at thoſe eternall things, truſt in an eternall Saviour, who hath purchaſed them firſt, and ſince provided them for you. He is gone before, to provide heavenly things for you. Grace is a thing, which hath ſomething of eternity in it. The way of holineſſe, the Scripture calleth it, the everlaſting way, Pſal. 139. ult. <hi>Lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> Seek to Chriſt for that. For your everlaſting Saviour will give you that which <note place="margin">Grace begets Glory.</note> hath an influence into eternity; ſo Grace hath.

                     <hi>of the Word with the Father;</hi> and it lyeth in theſe words, <hi>The word was with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Word,</hi> we ſtill underſtand the ſame Perſon, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By <hi>God,</hi> in this Propoſition, ye are to underſtand the <hi>Father.</hi> For you muſt know, this tearm <hi>[God]</hi> is taken two manner of waies in this Verſe. Sometimes the term <hi>[God]</hi> is taken <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and ſo it is appliable to all the Perſons in the Trinity; as when it is ſaid, <hi>God is a Spirit; God</hi> there is taken, ſo as to ſignifie the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, and the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of God, which is common to all the three Perſons. And ſo it is taken in the laſt clauſe of this Verſe, <hi>The word was God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But otherwhile it is taken <hi>Perſonally,</hi> and ſo it ſignifieth not the whole <hi>Eſſence,</hi> but ſome one Perſon in the Trinity: As when it is ſaid, <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Son.</hi> When it is ſaid, Joh. 3. 16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son.</hi> Here is God loving the world, and giving Chriſt. So in the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>The word was with God;</hi> that is, with <hi>God</hi> the firſt Perſon. This implyeth at once, a <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and a <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> A <hi>Nearneſſe</hi> to God, <hi>The word was God;</hi> and yet a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> from him, for it was but <hi>with him.</hi> Now, that which is with another, doth imply a perſon diſtinct. We do not ſay, a man is with himſelf, but <hi>Peter</hi> is with <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Peter.</hi> So here, <hi>The word was with God.</hi> Take two or three places to help you to underſtand this. Joh. 1. 18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time; the onely begotten Son, which is in the boſome of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the Son in the boſom of the Father, that is, the <hi>Word</hi> with God. Here is a <hi>nearneſſe,</hi> and yet a <hi>Perſonall</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt near to, and yet diſtinct from, the Father.</note> 
                     <hi>diſtinction. Nearneſſe,</hi> for it is in the boſom; and yet a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall diſtinction,</hi> it is the Son in the Father's boſom. One more clear, that is fully parallel with the Text; that is, 1 Joh. 1. 2. <hi>The life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and bear witneſſe, and ſhew to you that eternall life which</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:168769:18"/> 
                     <hi>was with the Father. Eternall life</hi> is a Perſon here. By Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life ye muſt underſtand the very ſelf-ſame Perſon, who is called <hi>the word of life,</hi> in the firſt verſe. <hi>Eternall life</hi> is ſomething that was ſeen, and born witneſſe to, namely, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of whom, ſaith he, verſ. 1. <hi>they have ſeen him, and lookt upon him, and have handled the word of life.</hi> So that it is no new thing for <hi>John</hi> to call Chriſt, the <hi>Eternall life.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>This is the true God, and eternall life.</hi> What doth he ſay of this <hi>Eternal life?</hi> Why, that <hi>we have ſeen it, and bear witneſſe:</hi> That is, of that <hi>Eternall life</hi> which is with the <hi>Father.</hi> Take another, which is parallel to the Text, Prov. 8. 29, 30. where, by Wiſdom is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Chriſt, which ſaith of it ſelf, <hi>Then I was by him as one brought up with him, and was daily his delight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing alwaies before him, rejoycing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Where Chriſt is ſpoken of, as a ſon, in the preſence of the Father. He is ſaid to be with him, as here in the Text. Take notice of two Praepoſitions, there uſed, in reference to Chriſt; <hi>In,</hi> and <hi>With;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is ſaid, Joh. 14. 10. <hi>Believeſt thou not?</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Philip) He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father.</hi> And then he ſaith, <hi>I am in the Father, and he in me.</hi> Here Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> the Father, and, in my Text, <hi>with</hi> the Father; with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>[in]</hi> that noteth <hi>Unity; [with]</hi> that importeth <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction: [in]</hi> that falls upon the <hi>Eſſence, [with]</hi> that falleth upon the <hi>Perſon.</hi> So as, in plain tearms, Chriſt is <hi>in</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in regard of the Unity of the Eſſence, which is the ſame with that of the Father. Chriſt is <hi>with</hi> the Father, in regard of the Diſtinction of his Perſon. So as between the Son and the Father, there is <hi>alius</hi> &amp; <hi>alius,</hi> but not <hi>aliud</hi> &amp; <hi>aliud,</hi> as Divines ſay: That is, The Son is another Perſon from the Father, but not another thing from the Father. The Father and the Son are <hi>Unum,</hi> but not <hi>Unus;</hi> the Father and the Son are one Thing, but not one Perſon. Ye may truly ſay, The Son is <hi>with the Father,</hi> as my Text hath it; but ye cannot ſay, The Son <hi>is the Father,</hi> becauſe there is diſtinction of Perſons, and yet a perſonall Co-exiſtency, <hi>The word was with God.</hi> So ye have the meaning of that Propoſition.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:168769:18"/>
                  <p> Let us now make Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Take notice, here, of the diſtinction of Perſons in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> the Godhead, a diſtinction without their Divinity. Here is the Son, <hi>the word with God,</hi> and the <hi>Son with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> not divided from him. And yet one Perſon with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſo diſtinct one from another. <hi>With him,</hi> not without diſtinction; and <hi>in him,</hi> without diviſion. As in the night-time, if a man ſet up three Candles in a room, all theſe concurr to the lightning of the room; yet there is but one light: So, but one Eſſence in the Divinity. Yet here are three Candles that give that Light, but no man can ſay, that this light is peculiar to the Firſt Candle, and this to the Second, for all ſhine together; and yet the light of the ſecond Candle is with the firſt, but the light is all one. But O the depth! It is no wading here, farther than a man hath footing out of Scripture, for fear of being paſt our ſtanding, and be drowned. The <hi>Word</hi> of God is <hi>with God,</hi> and one Perſon with another; but, the manner How, as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid, when he met with ſome knots of difficulty in this Myſtery, I believe, ſaith he, I do not buſie my ſelf in ſearching over far; what we cannot make out in plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt make out in believing, where we have the Scripture for our bottom; onely take notice of ſuch a thing. Certainly, there is a diſtinction of Perſons in the Trinity. Here, is One with Another. <hi>The word was with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learn from hence to worſhip God, according <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to a diſtinction of Perſons. Learn we to worſhip, and look at Chriſt, as a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; or elſe we worſhip not Chriſt, but our own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. If we conceive him not as he is, as he is diſtinct. This is the great difference, between the Chriſtian and the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Religion, I might ſay, the Jewiſh too; for, the Turks and Jews agree, in that they hold one God, but deny a diſtinction of Perſons in the Godhead. We Chriſtians, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture, acknowledge that too; <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit and theſe three are one.</hi> And ſome kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity appeareth, in a way of reaſon, which we may take notice of, for the ſtrengthning of our faith in this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:168769:19"/> that there ſhould be a diſtinction of Perſons. God <note place="margin">The benefit of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Perſons.</note> the Father was the Perſon offended. Reconciliation was to be made. None but God hath enough in him to ſatisfie God. Therefore it was requiſite there ſhould be a Perſon, to ſatisfie the Perſon offended. That, the ſecond Perſon, the Lord Jeſus undertakes, and goeth through with it. But how ſhall this be made known? Poor man is as far off as ever he was, if he be left here; he hath no power in his own nature to reach this. Therefore there is a Third Perſon, the holy Ghoſt, who diſcovereth this, and applieth it. So that the Salvation of Man, is by the concurrence of the whole Trinity.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt here again take off my ſelf, with, <hi>O the depth!</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> did, <hi>Hoc magnum eſt Myſterium,</hi> This is a great Myſtery, a Myſtery rather to be adored, than ſearched into. Well, ſaith he: <hi>Quomodo eſſet Pluralitas in Unitate, &amp; uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas in Pluralitate;</hi> How there ſhould be a Plurality in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and how a Unity in Plurality; three Perſons, and yet but one Eſſence; <hi>Scrutari temeritas eſt,</hi> It is raſhneſſe to ſearch too far into it. <hi>Credere pietas,</hi> it is piety to believe it. <hi>Cognoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </label> the ſame caſe, with a ſhort Anſwer, <hi>He was a making Hell for ſuch as put theſe Queſtions.</hi> But there is a fairer Anſwer in the Text, which telleth you, That the <hi>Word</hi> that was in the beginning, before the Creatures were made, that <hi>Word was with God.</hi> God was delighting himſelf in his <hi>Word.</hi> God and his <hi>Word</hi> were a contriving the Redemption of Mankind, and had thoughts of peace towards the Elect from all Eternity. That place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. ſpeaketh ſomething to it, <hi>When he appointed the foundations of the world,</hi> verſ. 30, 31. <hi>then I was by him, as one brought up with him;</hi> or, as a Nouriſher, in Intention or decreeing of the Creatures, that were to be made; or out of the Church, that was to be
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168769:19"/> gathered out of the world. <hi>I was daily his delight, rejoycing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">God delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Son, before the world was</note> 
                     <hi>alwaies before him.</hi> This God was a doing before the world was made, he was delighting in his Son; this Text ſaith ſo, clearly. So ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 19, 20. <hi>The pretious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot; who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> Before the foundations of the world, what was God a doing? Plotting (as I may ſpeak with reverence) the work of mans Redemption; projecting my Redemption and thine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were, he had thoughts of peace and mercy towards us. Therefore we may truſt him as long as we live. When we think little of him, he thinks much of us.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Uſe we may make of this, is this; It ſhould <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>4</label> teach us, and I pray God we may all learn, infinitely to prize the love of Chriſt; I ſay, to prize and adore the love of Chriſt; Who, though he were from all Eternity, the <hi>Word with God,</hi> yet was pleaſed, in the fulneſſe of time, to become <hi>Emmanuel, God with us.</hi> What an act of reſpect and love was it in <hi>Moſes,</hi> to his Country-men the Jews, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Moſes</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding love to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, the Jewes.</note> poor Hebrews, in ſore bondage; and he in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, brought up in all the learning of the Egyptians, adopted by the King's daughter, full of honour (ſome ſay, <hi>Lord Treaſurer</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and they build their conjecture upon that, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>He forſook the treaſures of Egypt):</hi> It was a great thing for him to leave the Court, and ſort himſelf with poor Labourers at Brick-kilns; yet, that he did. Here is an act of great condeſcention in <hi>Moſes,</hi> of much reſpect to his Country, and love to the poor He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews. But what is this of <hi>Moſes</hi> to that of Chriſt, who was with God in the Court of Heaven, taken up with the mutuall delights, which the bleſſed Trinity had in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? To leave this, all this, for a time, and to come to be Man with us! To leave his Manſion, which was Heaven, and to pitch his Tent upon Earth, as the word ſignifieth, Joh. 1. 17. <hi>He dwelt amongſt us,</hi>

                     </gap>; that is, as in a Tent or Tabernacle. Do but conſider the difference of theſe two ſtates; that which Chriſt left, and that which Chriſt took: The former was a ſtate of incomprehenſible glory,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168769:20"/> 
                     <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.</hi> What was the ſtate of the Word?

From that eternall joy, he is pleaſed to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to thoſe intolerable ſorrows, to be <hi>a man of ſorrows, acquainted with grief.</hi> Bleſſed Saviour! may we well ſay, <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 3.</note> What a change haſt thou made, for thy love to us? of being with God, to be with Man; from the Father's Boſom, to the Virgin's Womb; from Heaven, to Earth; from Glory, (as ye have heard) to Shame; and from Joy, to Grief: And all this, for our ſakes. <hi>Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus</hi>

He, who was the delight of his Father from all Eternity, had his delight with the ſons of men; How ſhould the ſons of men have their delight in him? Hath Chriſt left Heaven for me, and ſhall not I leave the world for Chriſt? Hath he thus emptyed himſelf for me, of his Joy and Glory, for a time; and ſhall not I deny my ſelf for him, in my pleaſures, and profits, and eaſe? What a poor ſorry joy is that, which the world affordeth

                  </p>
                  <p>This is that which concerneth the Perſonall Co-exiſtency of Chriſt, with God the Father.</p>

                  <p>There is hardly any place of Scripture more abuſed, in a way of ſuperſtition, than the beginning of this Goſpell. It was a common thing in times of Popery (and I would to God it were aboliſhed wholly at this day) to write theſe words in certain Characters, and to tye the paper or parchment about people's necks, as a Charm againſt <hi>Agues;</hi> or as a Spell, to prevent ſome other miſchief. We ſhall, I hope, make better uſe of them, by how much this Scripture hath been wronged by others. Theſe words are a Charm indeed, but it is againſt Hereticall Opinions, and carnall diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. The Deniers of Chriſt's Divinity, never had ſuch a Charm as this is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. We have made ſome of them to that end, and hope to make more, as we do proceed.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Uſe from hence, is, that this very Propoſition, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>5</label> that <hi>the Word was with God,</hi> holdeth forth Comfort to us: For he that was with God in the beginning, is with him ſtill, and will be with him for everlaſting; <hi>with God</hi> then, and <hi>with God</hi> now, and <hi>with God</hi> to all eternity: And that under the notion of our <hi>Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. <hi>If any man</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt our Advocate.</note> 
                     <hi>ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father</hi> (So the phraſe is here, With the Father) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> He is there as an Advocate to plead a cauſe: And what cauſe? His own as well as ours. We know, when a Counſellor is employed in a Cauſe, that concerneth himſelf as well as his Clyent, he is wont to be exceeding active in that buſineſſe, more than in other; he will neglect no opportunity in ſuch a Cauſe. So, Chriſt is ſuch an Advocate, as to be a Propitiation for our ſins. And Chriſt ſhould loſe the price of his own Blood, if our Cauſe ſhould miſcarry before God the Father, with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168769:21"/> him, where he appeareth for us; Heb. 9. 24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven it ſelf, to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Obſerve that, <hi>[With God]</hi> and, <hi>[For us].</hi> He appeareth there as an Advocate appeareth for his Clyent; when ſuch a Cauſe is called upon, he pleadeth that Cauſe as an Advocate. So, Chriſt appeareth for us as our <hi>Proctor;</hi> He is <hi>God with us,</hi> and <hi>for us;</hi> and <hi>therefore able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to God by him; becauſe he liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Never fear, that any thing ſhall be wanting to thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſt will be ſure to perfect it. He will ſave to the uttermoſt, becauſe he liveth for ever.

This is the Rock of our ſalvation, <hi>The Word was God.</hi> But there will be frequent occaſion in this Goſpell of meeting with it, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak now but briefly of it. Take a few clear places, ſuch as our enemies know not how to evade; that in Rom. 9. 5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is over all, God bleſſed for evermore.</hi> Chriſt is here himſelf called, <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi> So, Tit. 2. 13. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Who is it that ſhall appear at the laſt Day in the Clouds, but Chriſt, who is called the great God, and our Saviour? <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans; <hi>The great God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus.</hi> And leſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:168769:21"/> any Heretick ſhould hope to ſhift it off (as they are as full of ſhifts, as the Serpent is of turnings and windings) and ſhould ſay, Why, Angels are called gods, and Magiſtrates are called gods. To ſtop their mouths, St. <hi>John</hi> telleth you, <hi>He is the true God;</hi> I, and God properly ſo called, The true God.</p>
                  <p>You know what they uſe to object againſt this, as if the <label type="milestone">

And the place ſeemeth to have ſome colour in it, Joh. 17. 13. <hi>This is life eternall, that they know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſeemeth to be made a different Perſon from the true God.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There is no neceſſity of limiting this phraſe, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>[The onely true God]</hi> to the Perſon of the Father, the Firſt Perſon in the Trinity. It is true indeed, that the word <hi>Thee</hi> in the third Verſe, referreth to the word <hi>Father,</hi> in the firſt Verſe, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father, glorifie thy Son,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>this is eternall life, that we know thee the onely true God.</hi> Ye muſt know, the word <hi>Father</hi> is taken two manner of waies in Scripture: Firſt, Sometimes it is taken for the Firſt-Perſon in the Trinity. And <hi>Father</hi> is taken for the Divine Eſſence, or rather for an Attribute that is common to all the Perſons in the Trinity: Every one is <hi>Father,</hi> in this ſenſe. So, Chriſt is <hi>Father</hi> as well as the Firſt Perſon. He is called, <hi>The everlaſting Father;</hi> and, <hi>The Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. <hi>Father,</hi> in that ſenſe, is no more than, <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Mal. 2. 10. <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?</hi> There is a concurrence of all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this great work of Creation, and ſo in this Relation of <hi>Father.</hi> That, Jam. 1. 27. <hi>True religion, and undefiled before God and the Father. Father</hi> here belongeth to all the Perſons. 1 Pet. 1. 17. <hi>We know that all judgement is committed to Chriſt.</hi> So that <hi>Father</hi> is taken here <hi>eſſentially,</hi> and belongeth to all the <hi>Trinity.</hi> If ye underſtand it ſo here, then the Objection is of no force.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt is conceived here as Mediator, and as Man praying to the whole Trinity, under the name of <hi>Father,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſaying, <hi>This is eternall life, to know thee onely true God,</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:168769:22"/> 
                     <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So that, 1 Tim. 2. 5. is parallel, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Nothing is ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in Scripture, as to diſtinguiſh Chriſt as <hi>Mediator</hi> from God, taking the word <hi>eſſentially,</hi> for all the Perſons in the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppoſe the word <hi>[Father]</hi> Joh. 17. be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Perſonally,</hi> for the Firſt Perſon in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> yet the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> word <hi>[Onely]</hi> is not here to be limited to the Firſt Perſon. I pray you obſerve that, <hi>This is eternall life, that they know thee the onely true God.</hi> It is not, <hi>Thee onely, the true God,</hi> as if the Father onely were the true God. Indeed, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not to be tyed to the ſaying, <hi>[Thee onely]</hi> but, <hi>[Thee, God]</hi> is to be tyed to the word <hi>[Onely]</hi> To know thee the onely true God. So as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the word, <hi>[Onely]</hi> is not excluſive from the other two Perſons, the <hi>Son,</hi> and <note place="margin">God diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Creatures and Idols, not from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons.</note> the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> but onely excluſive from the <hi>Creatures,</hi> who are improperly called <hi>gods,</hi> as ſometimes <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> are called ſo; and <hi>Idols</hi> ſo called, falſly. <hi>The onely true God,</hi> excluding Idolls, but not the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> You may as well argue from that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. that God the Father is not <hi>Lord,</hi> as argue from this, that Chriſt is not <hi>the true God;</hi> for it is ſaid there, <hi>Though there be that are called gods both in heaven and in earth, as there be gods many, and lords many. But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> But <hi>one Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> May men from hence argue, and ſay, The Father is not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? But many argue and ſay, That Chriſt is not God, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>There is but one God the Father, of whom are all things.</hi> I will not hold you long upon this, becauſe I hope there are not many here, that need ſolution in this point, though the errour be ſpreading. Conſider that place, Matth. 11. 27. <hi>All things are delivered to me of my Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And, <hi>None knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any the Father ſave the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi> None knoweth the Son but the Father. Why, doth not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:168769:22"/> the Son know himſelf? doth not the holy Ghoſt know the Son? Yes. It is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God. Neither knoweth any the Father ſave the Son.</hi> Doth not the Father know himſelf? and the holy Ghoſt, both the Perſons? Yes. But this <hi>none</hi> excludeth Creatures, from the other Perſons. So the true God is diſtinguiſhed from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Idolls, not from the other Perſons in the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>I will make Uſe of this, to meet with ſuch Hereticks as <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> deny this: Would to God I could ſay, there were none in this City; but mine ears have heard a man, ſtifly to deny the Divinity of Chriſt, and diſpute againſt it, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme that great truth, without which, I think, a man may ſafely ſay, there is no poſſibility of ſalvation. I wonder, that of all the old Errors, ſwept down into this latter Age, as into a ſink of time, this of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Beware of Hereſies.</note> ſhould be held forth amongſt the reſt. Let us beware of their doctrines, ſhun their meetings and perſons, that come to us with the denyall of the Divinity of Chriſt in their mouths. This was <hi>John</hi>'s doctrine, and his practiſe. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, that after he was returned from his Baniſhment, and came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he came to bathe himſelf; and in the Bath he found <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> that ſaid, Chriſt had no beeing, till he received it from the <hi>Virgin Mary:</hi> Upon the ſight of whom, <hi>John</hi> skipped out of the Bath, and called his companions from thence, ſaying, <hi>Let us go from this place, leſt the Bath ſhould fall down upon us, becauſe</hi> Cerinthus <hi>is in it, that is ſo great an enemy to God.</hi> Ye ſee his Doctrine, ſee his words too, 2 Joh. 10, 11. <hi>If any come to you, having not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God-ſpeed: for he that biddeth him God-ſpeed, is partaker of his evill deed.</hi> What the Doctrine was, ye may ſee to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Divinity of Chriſt. This is one word to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to confute the gainſayers; but it is not the main: I will not therefore ſtand upon it in this <hi>Auditory.</hi> As it is with the Angels that are miniſtring Spirits, for the good of the Church; ſo it ſhould be with the Miniſters, that are called, the <hi>good Angels</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> are fometimes put upon conflicts with the <hi>Devil,</hi> they have many combats with the wicked Spirits, as may be gathered
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:168769:23"/> out of <hi>Daniel.</hi> But, this is but in order to their miniſtring for the good of the <hi>Elect.</hi> They conflict with evill Spirits, that they may be ſerviceable for the good of the Church.

Who can forgive ſins but God? Ye expect forgivneſſe <note place="margin">The promiſes cannot be made good; if Chriſt be not God.</note> of ſins by Chriſt. What ſoul can get to Heaven, if Chriſt be not God? He hath promiſed eternall life to all that love him, and believe in him; How ſhall a man have this Promiſe made good, if He be not God? If a man that hath never a foot of land in <hi>England,</hi> ſhall make his Will, and bequeath to thee ſuch and ſuch Houſes, and Land, in ſuch a Town and County, whereas he was never the owner of any ſuch Houſes or Land: Certainly, this Deed is null, thou art never a whit the nearer enriching thy ſelfe with ſuch a Legacy. If Heaven be not in Chriſt's diſpoſe, how can we have it as his gift? If Chriſt be not God, we cannot have Heaven. If Chriſt be not God, we are all ſtill in our ſins. For, the Juſtice of God expects ſatisfaction to be made, for the ſins of men; we cannot make ſatisfaction, but our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt. Chriſt is our Surety. If Chriſt be not God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is null; for, an infinite Juſtice offended, muſt have an infinite Price paid. A man may ſatisfie the Juſtice of man, but what man can ſatisfie the Juſtice of God? <hi>Will God accept the firſt-born of thy body for the ſin of thy ſoul?</hi> No, he will not. Yet he will accept His <hi>Firſt-born</hi> for the ſins of the world, for in him he is well pleaſed. There lyeth a great deal of ſtrength upon that place, it is a ſpeciall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of faith; Act. 20. 28. <hi>Over which the holy Ghoſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt is God.</note> 
                     <hi>hath made you over ſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> The Church of God,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168769:23"/> which he hath purchaſed with his <hi>own blood.</hi> This muſt needs relate to Chriſt. And Chriſt is here called God, and Chriſt's Blood is called the Blood of God. Chriſt could never have gone through with the purchaſe of the Church, if the Blood he ſhed had not been the <hi>Blood of God.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Juſtice of God can exact, that the Blood of God can diſcharge. The blood of man would not have done it; the blood of men or Angels would not have done it. Man ſinned, and Man muſt ſatisfie. Therefore the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be aſſumed by a Surety, for a man cannot do it. If an Angel ſhould have aſſumed Human Nature, it would <note place="margin">Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſumed by none but God.</note> have polluted him; Human Nature was ſo defiled by ſin, that it could not be aſſumed by any but God. Now Chriſt being God, the Divine Nature purified the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he took, and ſo it was a ſufficient Sacrifice. The perſon offered in ſacrifice was God, as well as Man. This is a ground whereupon a Beleever may challenge Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to ſay his worſt, and doe his worſt! Let him preſent God, as terrible; Let him preſent me, as abhominable in the ſight of God, by reaſon of my ſins; Let him aggravate the heighth of God's diſpleaſure, and the heighth, and depth, and length, and breadth, of my ſins; I grant all. And, againſt all this, I oppoſe this infinite Satisfaction of Chriſt. Though the Juſtice of God cannot be bribed, yet it may be ſatisfied. Here is a proportionable Satisfaction; here is <hi>God</hi> anſwering <hi>God.</hi>

Juſtice indeed requireth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, but it requireth it of the perſon that ſinneth. Here commeth in Mercy, that a Surety ſhall be accepted; and what he doth, is, as if the perſon that offended ſhould have done it himſelf. Here is Mercy and Salvation ſurely bottomed upon both.

It may be thought, that ſome, or all of theſe three things, may be aimed at.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it may be thought to aime, at ſhewing us that theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> are to be referred to all the three Clauſes and Propoſitions, in the firſt Verſe, whereas they are there annexed but to one of them; <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> ſaith he, verſ. 1. Now the ſecond Verſe, knitteth the ſame words to the ſecond Propoſition, <hi>The ſame, in the beginning, was with God, and the ſame was God.</hi> So that ye muſt put both into that Propoſition, which concerneth the eternall <hi>Exiſtency</hi> of Chriſt, and to that which concerneth the Perſonall Coexiſtency, <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> and the <hi>divine Eſſentialneſſe</hi> with God, <hi>The ſame was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though he were with God in the beginning, may ſome ſay, yet it is queſtioned, whether he were God then. This addition will prevent ſuch miſtakes, to ſhew you, the words, <hi>In the beginning,</hi> is to be put to every Propoſition. That may be one aime.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There may be another: In the former Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:168769:24"/> The Evangeliſt had told you of Chriſt's <hi>Co-exiſtency with the Father,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> and he addeth, <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God.</hi> Here he telleth you of his <hi>Co-working with God,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Coexiſtency with God.</hi> In the beginning, As he was then a Perſon diſtinct from the Father, and coexiſtent with him; So, ſo ſoon as the Father began to work, He began to work. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> He was ſo with him, as to work together with him, in the work of Creation in all things.</p>
               <p>Or perhaps, neither of theſe are intended. But the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> aimeth at a third thing, which is, To ſhew the great neceſſity of the aforeſaid Truth. This ye may take with you, <note place="margin">Repetition of much uſe in Scripture.</note> as a rule to help you in the interpretation of Scripture: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions have divers uſes in Scripture; we find them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent both in Prayer and Prophecy, in Threatnings and Precepts, and in the laying down of Truths. Repetitions have their ſeverall uſes in all theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>Prayer.</hi> Repetition ſerveth to note frequency in <note place="margin">1. In <hi>Prayer,</hi> it argueth affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> the ſame things, ſaid over again with new affections; as, <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken, and do.</hi> Take the inſtance of Chriſt; we read of his fervency and earneſtneſſe in prayer, eſpecially in his Agony, Luk. 22. 44. <hi>Being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly.</hi> How doth he expreſſe this earneſtneſſe? Matth. 26. 44. He went away the third time, praying the fame words, <hi>Father, if it be thy will, let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> So the ſecond, and the third time, it is ſaid. This Repetition ſerveth to note Chriſt's earneſtneſſe in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in <hi>Prophecies.</hi> Repetition ſerveth to note the <note place="margin">2. In <hi>Prophecies,</hi> it noteth cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſpeed, and the certainty of them.</note> certainty of them, together with their celerity and ſpeed. That reaſon is given by God himſelf, Gen. 41. 32. <hi>For that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice, it is becauſe the thing is eſtabliſhed by God, and he will ſurely bring it to paſſe.</hi> The doubling doth note the certainty of the thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in <hi>Threatnings.</hi> Repetition noteth unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, <note place="margin">3. In <hi>Threatnings,</hi> it noteth una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidableneſſe and ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> and, perhaps, ſuddainneſſe. Ye have, Ezek. 21. 27. <hi>I will overturn, overturn, and it ſhall be no more.</hi> Twice, I will overturn, to ſhew, that their overthrow ſhould be unavoidable.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:168769:25"/>
               <p> Fourthly, in <hi>Precepts.</hi> Repetition ſerveth to note <note place="margin">4. In <hi>Precepts,</hi> it noteth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them.</note> a neceſſity of performing them. So, Pſal. 47. 6. <hi>Sing praiſes to God, ſing praiſes to our King; ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes.</hi> Four times, to ſhew the neceſſity of that duty.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to our preſent purpoſe, in <hi>Truths.</hi> Repetition ſerveth to ſhew the neceſſity of believing them, and of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">5. In <hi>Truths,</hi> it ſerveth to know the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them.</note> them. So, in that great Truth of Regeneration, ye ſee, Chriſt repeateth it thrice with one breath, in his Sermon to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Joh. 3. 3. <hi>Except ye be born again, ye cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>Except a man be born of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> And, <hi>Marvel not I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again,</hi> verſ. 17. So here, the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> repeateth this great Truth, to ſhew the abſolute neceſſity of our knowing it, and believing it. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the ſame that was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we are to note from hence, is this: Firſt, in generall, The uſefulneſſe and lawfulneſſe of repeating the ſame things: <hi>To me,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) it is not burdenſom; for you, it is ſafe,</hi> Phil. 3. 1. We are all by nature, as Chriſt ſaid of his Diſciples, <hi>fools, and ſlow of heart to believe</hi> this great Myſtery of God, Luk. 24. 25. <hi>Then ſaid he unto them, Oh fools, and ſlow of heart to believe all that was ſpoken.</hi> Slow of heart, they had therefore need to be ſwitcht and ſpurr'd again and again; had need to have the goad thruſt in, a firſt, ſecond, and third time. That is the expreſſion, Eccleſ. 2. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads, and as nails faſtned by the maſters of the aſſemblies.</hi> So neceſſary are Repetitions of Truths. It is in this caſe, as with <hi>Peter,</hi> in his viſion of the Sheet, when all ſorts of Beaſts came down, clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean. Upon the firſt letting them down, when it was ſaid, <hi>Ariſe, Peter, kill, and eat. Not ſo, Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> he could not think it lawfull, when it was preſcribed at the firſt; but the Sheet was let down a ſecond time, and a third time; then he was convinced, which at firſt he was not. So, a man may hear a truth at firſt, and may ſay, <hi>Not ſo, Lord;</hi> he cannot reliſh this for a truth: but, it may be, at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or third time, he may reliſh it. It is not with Truth

                  </note> two, and ſo thtow them away. But for neceſſary Truths, they will not die in your hands: they are not like Flowers; they are like Jems, pretious Stones, that keep a luſtre from year to year, they are alwaies ſhining and bright. Ye may wear them while ye live, and not be weary of them. This in generall.</p>
               <p>But then in Speciall: From this Repetition which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> maketh, obſerve, That the <hi>Eternity,</hi> the <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt, are of neceſſity to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Becauſe we cannot rightly worſhip God, without the belief of theſe Truths; namely, <hi>That the Word was in the beginning, and that the Word was then God, and was with God from everlaſting to everlaſting.</hi> For we muſt worſhip the Son, even as we worſhip the Father; ſo ſaith Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. And that, unleſſe we acknowledge the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt, and the Divinity of Chriſt, the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; as well as of God the Father, the Firſt Perſon; we honour neither Father nor Son. And this is it that excludeth both Turks and Jews: who, though they both acknowledge one God, yet they deny the Diſtinction of Perſons, deny the Son of God, and ſo the Divinity of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> We ſee now, what miſerable caſe ſuch men are in, as deny Chriſt thus. It is remarkable, that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. if you compare the beginning with the end, <hi>At that time ye were without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> Without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and without <hi>God.</hi> He is an Atheiſt that knoweth not Chriſt; whatſoever he may hold of God. There can be no true knowledge of God, where there is not a true knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Ye were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, and without God in the world.</hi> Wherefore, my Brethren, pray, that ye may underſtand theſe things; for, indeed, they are things that depend upon Revelation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they call for prayer. Saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> of the Myſtery of the Trinity, The beſt way of ſeeking it, and the eaſieſt way of finding it, is, not to enter upon Diſputings, but Prayer. To Prayer, add the uſe of the beſt Means, reading the Word of God, in which theſe Myſteries are revealed, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168769:26"/> the <hi>Eternity,</hi> and <hi>Perſonality,</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, Scripture will help you more then Reaſon here.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of things. Some things there are which we do firſt underſtand, and then believe; Others which we firſt believe, and then come to underſtand. If ye <note place="margin">Naturall things are firſt underſtood, then believed. Supernaturals not ſo.</note> go to naturall things, firſt ye underſtand them, apprehend the inſide and outſide of them, and then believe them, becauſe ye underſtand them. But now, in theſe great ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Myſteries, that ye may underſtand them, you muſt firſt believe them. For this there are two rules.</p>
               <p>If ye will firſt ſet Reaſon on work, believe no more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ye can find out in theſe Myſteries; That will hinder Faith; But if, after ye have believed them, ye will ſet reaſon a work, that may help faith. The <hi>Arians</hi> of old that denied the Divinity of Chriſt, they got a great deal of advantage, eſpecially over <hi>Women,</hi> by putting queſtions for grounds of reaſon to them: They were wont to come to <hi>Women,</hi> and <note place="margin">The <hi>Arians</hi> deluſion and ſophiſtry.</note> aske them. Haſt thou born a Child, ſay they? Yes. And art thou not older then the Child thou haſt born? why, yes, ſay they. And yet, ſay they, our Adverſaries, They tell us, that God hath a Son, and that the Son is Co-eternall with the Father. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> goeth to work to confute them, thus; I aske you a queſtion. Canſt thou build a houſe without Timber, and Stone, and other Materialls? no: yet God made the World without any of theſe things. If Gods buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be not as an Artificer's, God made the World without Materialls. He hath his Son from Eternity, but not as a naturall parent, <hi>for who can declare his generation?</hi> If ye will aske a queſtion, Ask the Sun, if ever it were without its beams. Aske the Sun, if it did not ſhine as ſoon as it was Created. And aske the Fountain, if ever it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its ſtreams. As the Sun was never without its beams, nor the Fountain without its ſtreams, ſo God was never without his Son: <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> both <hi>Co-exiſtent,</hi> and <hi>Eternall.</hi>

But whereas, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a new Creation; we are hinted to think of a double Creation, There is <hi>the old Creation,</hi> and <hi>the new Creation.</hi> Now ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> make a queſtion, which of the two is here meant, There is the old Creation ſpoken of by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Geneſis, In the beginning God Created Heaven, and Earth.</hi> And there is the new Creation ſpoken of by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: old things are paſt away, behold all things are become New.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The queſtion is, which of theſe the Text is meant of, <hi>All things were made by Him. Socinus,</hi> who denieth the <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>As this is not true, ſo it will not ſerve his turn. It is not true, nor conſonant to the Text, which doth not ſay, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168769:27"/> all things were made <hi>new</hi> by Him, <hi>but that all things were made by Him;</hi> and undeniably ſpoken of the Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>Neither will it ſerve his turn.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168769:27"/> Commandement, Exod. 20. 11. In ſix dayes, the Lord made <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>all things that are therein.</hi> Theſe are the heads of the <hi>All things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Heaven: Heaven is a fair building, a glorious Fabrick of three Stories, the firſt, ſecond, and third Heaven. <note place="margin">1. Heaven.</note> So <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us to diſtinguiſh, when he ſpeaks of his being rapt up into the third Heaven. Therefore there is a ſecond, and firſt, as well as a third. And theſe three Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were ſweetly reſembled, by thoſe three Courts in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Temple. There was the firſt Court, the outward Court, and the Court of the Gentiles, which was common for all ſorts of people to come into; So is the firſt Heaven here below, Men breathe in the aire, birds and beaſts they live and breathe in the aire, which is the firſt Heaven. The ſecond Court was ſomething more hidden: In that the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks were, which were the Lights, that lighted the Temple. So are the Sun, Moon, and Stars in the ſecond Heaven. The third Court, was the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> into which entred none, but the high Prieſt. And the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is the Heaven of Heavens, into which Jeſus Chriſt the high Prieſt is entred, to prepare a place for all his Members. All theſe Heavens were of Chriſt's making, Hebr. 110. <hi>Thou Lord, in the beginning, haſt laid the foundations of the World, and the Heavens are the work of thy Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond head, is the <hi>Earth,</hi> the Circle of the World, the pavement of this glorious Fabrick, the foot-ſtool of the <note place="margin">2. Earth.</note> moſt high God. Of his making it, you have an excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in <hi>Job,</hi> Job 38. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Where waſt thou, when I laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> ſaith God, there; <hi>declare, if thou haſt underſtanding, who hath laid the meaſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if thou knoweſt? or who hath ſtretched out the line thereof? wherein are the foundations thereof faſtned, or who laid the Corner-ſtone thereof?</hi> God hath ſo made it, as to make it <note place="margin">The admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of the fabrick of the Earth.</note> admirable to our underſtandings; that ſuch a vaſt body, as the Earth is, of a round figure, and ſo fit for motion, ſhould be ſtill immoveable! a body ſo heavy, ſhould yet be able to hang, as it doth, in the midſt of the air! Why, God hath faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by a Word of his own power, Job 26. 7. <hi>He ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168769:28"/> 
                     <hi>Earth upon nothing.</hi> Which of us can hang a ball in the aire, without ſome ſupport? God, He hangeth the Earth; how? upon nothing, but upon the aire without ſide of it.</p>
                  <p>Then Thirdly the <hi>Sea,</hi> Pſal. 95. 5. <hi>The ſea is his, and He made it,</hi> ſo, as to make all men rejoyce in the thoughts of it, <note place="margin">3. Sea.</note> Pſal. 97. 1. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the Earth rejoyce, let the multitude of the Iſles be glad thereof.</hi> It is with an <hi>Emphaſis:</hi> All ſorts of men, that dwell in Iſlands, have much cauſe to rejoyce, becauſe God reigneth. For if He did not Reign, and Rule, and bound the Seas, with which they are compaſſed, they would quickly be deſtroyed. If God did <note place="margin">God bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Seas, being above the Earth; elſe the Iſlands would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> not reign, the naturall place of the Sea is above the Earth, and how ſhould we in this Iſland be overflowed in a moment, if He bounded not the ſeas? Ye ſhall ſee an elegant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon in Job 38. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Who ſhutteth up the Sea with doors, when it breaketh forth, as if it had iſſued out of the Womb, when I made the Clouds the garments thereof, and thick darkneſſe a ſwadling band for it, and brake up for it my decree'd place, and ſet barres, and doors.</hi> Here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the ſea to a Child, breaking out of the Womb of his Decree; to a Child ſwadled, as it were with a Cloud. That is the expreſſion, Thick darkneſſe hath ſwadling bands for it. And it is rock't, as it were, in a Cradle of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>The fourth head, is, Theſe <hi>All things,</hi> (as that place in <hi>Exodus</hi> telleth you) are the things that are within this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">4. All things.</note> and Earth, and Sea. And all things therein. Which <hi>Paul</hi> reduceth to two heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Things <hi>Viſible,</hi> and</item>
                     <item>Things <hi>Inviſible,</hi> Col. 1. 16.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Him were all things Created that are in Heaven, and Earth, viſible, and inviſible. Zanchius</hi> addeth a third branch to this diſtinction, and maketh it more plain, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>all things that were made,</hi> are either <hi>viſible,</hi> or <hi>inviſible,</hi> or <hi>mixt. Viſible</hi> things, as the <hi>Stars,</hi> and <hi>Fouls,</hi> and <hi>Clouds</hi> of Heaven, the <hi>fiſh</hi> in the ſea, and <hi>beaſts</hi> upon the earth. <hi>Inviſible</hi> things, as the <hi>Angells,</hi> they alſo were made. They were not the Makers of the World, as ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> have thought. Then there is a third ſort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168769:28"/> which are of a mixt nature, partly viſible in regard of their bodies, and partly inviſible in regard of their ſouls, and thoſe are Men. And ſo you have, <hi>The all things.</hi> Not to ſtand upon that, I will paſſe to another head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, let us Conſider. <hi>In what order theſe things were made,</hi> That ſo we may learn the more to magnifie the <note place="margin">2. In what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> Creatour. This ye ſhall have under ſundry Conſiderations. No way more profitable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, all things were made ſo, in ſuch an order, as that <note place="margin">1. Heaven made before the Earth.</note> Heaven, a place of bleſſedneſſe, was made before the Earth, the Stage of vanity. In the beginning, God created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth; To teach us, that we ſhould begin our ſearch, and deſires, and love, where God began his Work firſt, at Heaven; and then at Earth. It is a Praepoſterous courſe, that is taken, to begin with earth: God did not ſo, He firſt made the Heavens; <hi>Firſt, ſeek the Kingdome of God,</hi> Math. 6. 33. And yet, through the Corruption of mens ſouls, <hi>Curvae in terras animae, Coeleſtium inanes,</hi> The moſt are bowed down to the Earth, and few look up towards Heaven. There are in the Militant Church ſome dead, and ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Children; ſome true, and ſome falſe Profeſſors. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Woman ſhould have a dead, and a living Child toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her Womb. The dead Child would make no way for his birth, the living would; ſo it is here, ſuch as are dead Profeſſors in the Womb of the Church, they do not make forward towards Heaven. But every living ſoul that is born for Heaven, and ordained for Heaven, will to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Every ſoul that is baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire, hath a fire in it, that will carry it up Heaven-ward.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as in order to the Creation, Things of leſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <note place="margin">2. Things leſſe-perfect before more-perfect, in the viſible world.</note> were made before things that are more perfect, as if ye come to the viſible World eſpecially; not, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the inviſible Heavens are more perfect then any thing we ſee. But I ſay the viſible World. God in the work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation went from things leſſe perfect, to thoſe that had more perfection in them. Firſt he made the Elements, then the mixt bodies compounded of them; and, amongſt them, ſuch as had life, before thoſe that had ſenſe; and ſuch as had ſenſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168769:29"/> before thoſe that had reaſon. A thing profitable to obſerve, that ſo ye may look at Gods method, both in Nature, and Grace. His method is to begin with the loweſt and ſo goe upward; to begin with leſſe perfection, and ſo go on to more. Do we aime at the top of Grace? Wee muſt climb up by certain ſteps; The New Creature goeth on as the Old Creature dyeth, from the leſſe perfect, to the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Never expect Love, and Fear, and Joy, and all at the firſt: God's work will be going on ſtill, from leſſe, to more perfection.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as to the poynt of order in the making of all <note place="margin">3. The eſſentiall part of the world made before its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</note> things, God he made the Eſſentiall part of the World before he made their Ornaments. As ye know, he made the the Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, before he made their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; before He furniſhed the Heaven with Starres, and the Earth with Plants and Beaſts, and the Sea with Fiſhes. To teach us to look, in the poynt of Grace too, for the like proceeding. There are Eſſentiall Graces, and Graces that tend to Ornament. Eſſentiall Graces that goe to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Chriſtian: Such are Faith, and Love. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary graces that tend to his Ornament, and well-being: Such are joy, and aſſurance. Obſerve now Gods method, He firſt begins with the moſt eſſentiall happineſſe: but he that by faith layeth hold on Chriſt, and by love cleaveth to Chriſt, it may be God will make him ſtay ſome time for his Ornaments, before he furniſheth him with full Aſſurance; even as a Heaven, before ſtarres to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it.</p>
                  <p>Again, It may be obſerved in order of Gods Creation. <note place="margin">4. He made things depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, before the things they depend upon.</note> That he made ſome things, which now depend upon others, before the things upon which they depend. For inſtance, the light ye know dependeth upon the Sun, the Sun being removed, we ſhall have no light; but yet God made the light before any Sun. The light was the work of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, and the Sun not made till afterwards. The growing of Plants, and Fruits now depend much upon the husbandry of men, and upon ſhowers and rain; yet God made them before any raine, or any man to till the ground, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:168769:29"/> 
                     <hi>it grew, for the Lord had not cauſed it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</hi> To teach us thus much, That all the Creatures though they be ſubordinate one to another, doe yet depend more upon God, the firſt Cauſe, then upon any ſecond Cauſe. And to let us underſtand, That we have reaſon to depend upon God, though we ſee no meanes. He that can maintain a light without a Sun, and cauſe things to grow without rain, he can maintain grace in thy heart, though thou haſt no means, or but ſmall means of thriving in that way. I do but hint theſe things by the way, as profitable Obſervations from the Creation of the World.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly in poynt of order, God made Man laſt of all. He, ye know, was the workmanſhip of the ſixth day, and that to <note place="margin">5. He made Man laſt of all.</note> the end we might ſee both his wiſdome and his goodneſſe; a great deal of wiſdome in this, That after God had raiſed ſuch a glorious Fabrick as the world is, he ſhould do as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men are wont to do. A man that buildeth, (ſuppoſe) a <hi>Library,</hi> or <hi>Exchange,</hi> or ſome ſuch Monumentall place; It is uſuall for ſuch perſons to ſend their Pictures thither, and to have them hanged up therein, that all may know at whoſe charge that was done. So God made the World, and furniſheth it, and then ſendeth his own Picture, and maketh man after his own Image, and putteth him into the World. And at ſuch a time as the Wiſdome of God had provided it, and furniſhed it. That man ſhould be ſo made as to let him ſee, that he was made to ſerve God, as other things to ſerve him: Therefore he is not created, till the latter end of the ſixth day, immediately before the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> that ſo the firſt work which he takes in hand, might be the worſhip of God that made him. Here is wiſedome, and goodneſſe, in this, aboundant goodneſs! God would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite man unto bare walls, but firſt he buildeth, and furniſheth a houſe, and then bringeth his gueſt into the houſe, that Man at firſt might taſte and ſee how good the Lord was. And that all men might learn for ever to truſt him. He that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for us a being, will he not, now he hath given us a being, maintain us? Theſe things I obſerve to you, from the Order.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:168769:30"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Let us inquire into <hi>the ſpace of Time;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">3. In what ſpace of time.</note> all theſe things were made. I do it the rather to let you ſee what Doctrine may be ſucked out of theſe firſt Principles of Religion. <hi>In ſix dayes the LORD created Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</hi> Here are divers Conſiderations to be deduced from hence.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God could have done all things in a moment, yet it pleaſed him to be ſix dayes about this great work. <hi>Dayes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. To teach us Deliberation.</note> and not <hi>Moments.</hi> Firſt, to teach us the neceſſity of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation in all matters of Conſequence. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God could have done all in a Moment; but he was pleaſed to take time about it, that he might thereby inform us, of the neceſſity of taking time, when we undertake things of Conſequence. Many a man doth that in haſte, that he <note place="margin">Serius abſolvit, qui nimiùm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.</note> repenteth him of at leiſure, whereas he ſhould not have had cauſe to repent, if he would have taken leiſure in doing of it: <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>He required time of the King,</hi> when he had a hard taske.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>dayes</hi> and not <hi>years.</hi> Here is an obſerveable <note place="margin">2. To bleſſe God more for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming us, than for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us.</note> difference between the work of Creation, and the work of Redemption. The one was finiſhed in ſix dayes; but it coſt Chriſt three and thirty years pilgrimage upon earth, before he came to ſay, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> So much more noble is the one work, than the other. So much doe we owe more to God for his having Redeemed us, than for his having Made us. There is not one of us, but oweth himſelf to God for his Creation. If we had a thouſand, yea ten thouſand ſelves, we ſhould owe them all to Chriſt for our Redemption, becauſe that is the greater worke; it tooke God a longer time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly in poynt of time. All things were made in ſix diſtinct ſeverall dayes; That ſo God might help us the better <note place="margin">3. To help us the better to underſtand the making of all things.</note> to underſtand this great work. It is too vaſt for us to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend at once, The making of all things. Therefore God was pleaſed to caſt it into ſix ſeverall dayes, that ſo he might follow his work in our meditations. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, Such a day was ſuch and ſuch a Creature made; that we might runne through all the Creatures, as it were, by theſe ſeverall
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168769:30"/> ſtages, and let our affections goe on, as God went on in working.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. But <hi>ſix dayes. De Poſſe,</hi> God might have done <note place="margin">4. To ſee, how great things God can do in a ſhort time.</note> it in a moment. But <hi>defacto,</hi> he did it in ſix dayes. We ſee how great a thing God can do in a ſhort time. That which men and Angells could not have done, though he had given them a thouſand millions of years to have perfected it. Thirteen years was <hi>Solomon</hi> a building the firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And forty yeares were the <hi>Jews</hi> a building the ſecond Temple. Here in ſix dayes, Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, and All things therein are made. Therefore truſt God, be thou never ſo low in thy eſtate, or name, or body, or Soul: He that raiſed the World out of nothing in ſix dayes, how ſoon is he able to raiſe thee to a Competencie of theſe things?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Six dayes,</hi> and no more. God caſt it ſo, as we may <note place="margin">5. To limit us a time of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> think, on purpoſe, to limit us a time of working, and a time of reſting. He himſelf wrought ſix dayes, and reſted the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day from all his works. To teach us, That we ſhould have ſix dayes to labour in, and keep the ſeaventh as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, but the ſeaventh day is the Sabbath of reſt, an holy Convocation: ye ſhall do no work therein, It is the Sabbath of the Lord, in all your dwellings.</hi> That is the third thing. Ye have heard what theſe All-things are. In what order they were made. And in what ſpace of time they were created. See now next, In what manner they were created.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>In what manner were they made?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were made by the ſole word of God, without inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">4. In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> without materialls, meerly by the word of Command, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 5, 6. <hi>Praiſe him ye Heaven of heavens, and ye waters that be above the Heavens, let them praiſe the name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created. He hath eſtabliſhed them for ever and ever, he hath made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which ſhall not paſſe.</hi> You read of no <hi>Inſtruments. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> could not make a Temple, but he muſt have a thouſand of <hi>Tools.</hi> God doth but ſpeak the word, and the earth was made. You read of no <hi>materials</hi> out of which he made the world. What can men make, if you give them nothing to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168769:31"/> work upon. Let a Smith have Iron, and a Maſon Stone, and they can make ſome Work: but here God maketh all out of Nothing, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. <hi>Through faith we Underſtand that the World was framed by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do appear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly, God made Something of Nothing, and then out of that Something, made All things, as one well expreſſeth it. That which <hi>(Gen.</hi> 1.) is called the <hi>earth,</hi> and the <hi>water,</hi> and the <hi>deep,</hi> that <hi>firſt matter,</hi> it was made out of meer <hi>nothing.</hi> There is ſomething out of nothing, and then out of that firſt-Matter were all things framed. There is <hi>all things</hi> out of ſomething; ſo as, mediately or immediately, all the Creatures come out of Nothing. There is <hi>Non-ens negativum;</hi> And ſo the firſt matter, commeth out of nothing. There is, <hi>Non-ens privativum;</hi> And ſo the other things, they came out of that which is, <hi>Non-ens tale,</hi> a thing that had no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition to receive ſuch a form. And here is the omnipotency of God ſeen in both. For it requires as much power to produce ſuch and ſuch formes, as to produce that <note place="margin">God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent in the Creation.</note> firſt matter out of Nothing; and yet, This, God hath done. And this ſhould teach us both Obedience, and Humility, The conſideration of the manner of making all things. He made them all by his word. Who are we, that we ſhould diſobey the word of God, which every Creature was framed by. It is a ſhame for a man to be the worſt thing in his houſe. All the World is a houſe made for Man; and man appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf the worſt thing in the World, if he diſobey the Word of God. Fire, Haile, Ice, Snow, fulfill thy Word, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. He did but ſay, Let there be light, and the light preſently ſhined; How many words have we had? Ten words of the Law, as the Ten Commandements, all comprized in two Words under the Goſpell. <hi>Repent,</hi> and <hi>Believe,</hi> and how many are unbelieving and diſobedient ſtill? The Creatures caſt ſhame upon us in this particular, As they were made without Inſtruments, by a ſole word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo they were made of Nothing; This ſhould take down our Pride: ſhall we be proud of the Creature? That is to be proud of Nothing. Proud of our parts, or gifts?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168769:31"/> Who art thou? the Son of <hi>Adam?</hi> vvho is <hi>Adam?</hi> the Son of duſt. What is that duſt? The Son of nothing. All reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it ſelf into Nothing. And certainly he that hath brought ſomething out of nothing, can quickly reduce our ſomething, to nothing again, if we begin to be proud of it. As he did the parts, and power of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he took away his underſtanding, and turned him to eat graſſe with the beaſts of the field. Some thing ye have heard about the <hi>Things,</hi> and the <hi>Order,</hi> and the <hi>Manner,</hi> and the <hi>Time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, See now, <hi>the End for which all things were made.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. To what end.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> telleth you in one word, That they were all made for the glory of God, Prov. 16. 4. <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf. The Heavens declare the glory of God. The firmaments ſhew his handy works.</hi> Therefore this is the great improvement, we ſhould make of all the things that are made, to read ſomething of God in them. And this is a duty that lyeth eſpecially upon man. Man as he is the moſt conſiderable part of the viſible World, ſo the only Creature that can conſider the reſt: and it lyeth as a more ſtrong engagement upon him, to Glorifie God above all, becauſe no viſible Creature can do it, if man deny it. And it lyeth as a more ſtrong obligation upon Miniſters to Preach the Word, becauſe Regularly none but they can Preach. And alſo upon Kings to govern, and Merchants to trade, becauſe none can govern, none can trade, in ſuch things as they. No, none but Men can conſider, and praiſe God, for what he hath done in the World. Therefore every man ſhould look at this great book of the Creature, as that which is written all over, with ſomething of God.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, There is many a man caſt away for not reading, when he is put to this book: a <hi>Non legit,</hi> here, may deſtroy a man; for not reading the book of the Creature. Though ſome of us take it but for a morall fault. Obſerve that, Pſal. 28. 5. <hi>Becauſe they regarded not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> Why, Should God ſet before us ſuch a glorious piece as this is, and ſhall not we conſider it with a Contemplative eye? An Artiſt thinketh himſelf neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:168769:32"/> when he hangeth forth a Picture to be viewed, and no body give it the beholding. All creatures are active upon the ſtage of the world; but Man is a <hi>Spectator</hi> as well as an <hi>Actor;</hi> therefore they ſhould obſerve, not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <note place="margin">Man is not to obſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely, but what God doth in other Creatures.</note> onely, but whatſoever God doth in other creatures; and towards other creatures, as well as in and towards themſelves.</p>
                  <p>To this end, God hath fitted them with Senſe; to let the conſideration of him into their Underſtandings; and ſet them in ſuch a place of the world, as that they are compaſſed about, both with laſting works of Creation, Sun, Moon, Stars, Beaſts, Plants, and the like; and alſo with tranſient works of Providence, that paſſe over their heads daily. <hi>O therefore, that men would praiſe the Lord,</hi> and glorifie him in and for all theſe things that he hath made! That is the Uſe we ſhould make of it. Rev. 4. ult. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou haſt created all things: For thee they are, and were created.</hi> Rom. 1. 20. Therefore give him the glory of his power. Who, but God, could have created ſuch a Palace as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? and Pond, as the Sea? and Pavement, as the Earth? Give Him the glory of His wiſdom: <hi>O Lord, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold are thy works? In wiſdom haſt thou made them all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It requireth wiſdom to manage a great Family; much wiſdom to martiall a great Army. What wiſdom is it in God, not onely to make, but to govern all the hoſt of all the Creatures? <hi>In wiſdom haſt thou made them all, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doſt thou govern them.</hi> Let all therefore give Him the praiſe of his Goodneſſe; for the next words there ſay, <hi>The earth is full of thy riches;</hi> namely, of his goodneſſe to the ſons of men; becauſe, for us were all theſe things made, and we were made for God, as ye heard before. And therefore made after his own <hi>Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, my Brethren, What doth God expect from us, in a way of requitall for all theſe things, but that, as they ſerve <note place="margin">As the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſerveth us, ſo we ſhould ſerve the Lord.</note> us, ſo we ſhould ſerve him? That ſeeing we are made after his own Image, we ſhould repreſent him in our diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and carriages towards the ſons of men, in being holy, and meek, and loving, even as God himſelf is. Whoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168769:32"/> image and ſuperſcription is this, (will God ask one day) that is upon thy ſoul? Is it God's, after which thou art made? or is it Satan's? If the Devill's, give to Satan that which is Satan's. God will give the Devill his due, one day. If he findeth his own Image ſpunged out of us, and the Devill's ſtampt upon us, wo be to us. As it is ſaid of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> that, paſſing by the ſtreets, and ſeeing ſome of her Pictures hang for Signes, that were not made like her, ſhe was angry, and cauſed them to be pulled down, and thrown into the fire. Brethren, I ſpeak it with trembling: Should any of you carry ſouls about you, that do not look like God, they muſt be thrown down, and caſt into the fire. Thus have I run over a ſort of Conſiderations, from the great and glorious work of the Creation. The next thing is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Chriſt, as the <hi>Maker,</hi> the <hi>Efficient.</hi>

                  <p>I proceed now to the <hi>Efficient.</hi> Chriſt, the Eternall <hi>Word,</hi> was the Maker of them, <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> The Eternall <hi>Word</hi> was the Creator of all things.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſhall have this truth eſtabliſhed in the mouth of two or three witneſſes. Epheſ. 2. 9. <hi>Who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> will afford two pregnant teſtimonies, Heb. 1. 2. <hi>He hath in theſe laſt daies ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things; by whom alſo he made the worlds.</hi> This may ſeem ſomething difficult, becauſe he ſpeaketh of <hi>Worlds,</hi> whereas we acknowledg but one. Let it be conſidered whom he writes to, the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> whoſe cuſtome it was to ſtyle God, <hi>Rabboni, Dominus mundorum;</hi> The Lord of the Worlds. They were wont to ſpeak of three Worlds, the lower World, the higher World, and the middle World. The lower World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Elements, Earth, and Water, and Aire, and Fire. The higher World, that containeth the Heaven of the Bleſſed: And the middle World, that containeth the Starry Heaven. We now being acquainted with this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the Apoſtle writing to them, he ſaith, <hi>That God by Chriſt made the Worlds,</hi> thoſe worlds, which they were wont to ſpeak ſo frequently of.</p>
                  <p>And whereas one ſcruple might ariſe from this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Text, <hi>By him were all things made;</hi> that, in the <hi>Epheſians, God created all things [by] Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> this, to the <hi>Hebrews, By whom he made the worlds.</hi> As if Chriſt were onely an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in the Creation, and not the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Efficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore another place in this firſt Chapter will clear it, which ſpeaketh of Chriſt as the principall <hi>Efficient</hi> of all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. compare the 8th. and 10th. Verſes together, <hi>To the Son he ſaith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.</hi> And, <hi>Thou, Lord,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>haſt laid the foundations</hi>

There is nothing in my treaſures that I have not ſhewed them;</hi> there is the <hi>Negative:</hi> and both make up one compleat ſenſe. Jer. 42. 4. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:168769:34"/> 
                     <hi>thing, the Lord ſhall anſwer you, I will declare it to you,</hi> there is the <hi>Affirmative. I will keep nothing back from you,</hi> here is the <hi>Negative.</hi> And the ſenſe is inforced by it. Juſt as it is here. <hi>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not made any thing that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If ye look at them, as an Addition, to what <hi>Moſes</hi> had mentioned concerning the Creation. He had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made an expreſſe mention of all things viſible. Our <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">All things, viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt:</note> intending to carry the <hi>Efficiency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the making of all things that receive a being, whether viſible, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, or inviſible; therefore, he contenteth not himſelfe by ſaying, <hi>By Him were all things made,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth further, <hi>without Him was not made any thing that was made.</hi> The former clauſe hath reference to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid: The latter carrieth it further, <hi>All things viſible,</hi> and <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Coloſ. 1. 16. <hi>By him</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>who is the Image of the inviſible God, by Him) were all things created, that are in Heaven and Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers; All things were created by Him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe words are conſiderable, eſpecially as an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Explication of the former clauſe. <hi>By him were all things made,</hi> wherein are two things to be noted; The <hi>Efficient,</hi> and the <hi>Effect.</hi> Here is ſomething to explain both.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Effect,</hi> firſt. Theſe words, <hi>without him, was not any thing made, that was made. Any thing that was made,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> helpeth to explain, That theſe words limit <hi>All things</hi> in the former clauſe, to all created things; all things that receive a being: whereas, otherwiſe, God himſelfe, God the Father, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt, theſe are in the number of all things. The three Perſons in the Trinity, <note place="margin">God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Spirit, have the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beeing</note> have the moſt excellent Beeing. But ſome have brought deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate arguments from this Text, <hi>That Chriſt is a Creature,</hi> becauſe in the number of <hi>all things.</hi> Now, ſay the next words, <hi>without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> Ye muſt limit the firſt words, <hi>All things,</hi> that receive a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not that have a being. As the Apoſtle argueth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſe, ſo we may reaſon in this, 1 Cor. 15. 27. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet, but when he ſaith, All things,</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:168769:34"/> 
                     <hi>are put under him, it is manifeſt; That he is excepted, that put all things under him.</hi> So, all things are created by Him. But when He ſaith, All things are Created by Him, it is manifeſt, that he is excepted, by whom all things are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is ſomething to explain the <hi>Efficient,</hi> from theſe words, <hi>without him was not any thing made.</hi> It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a kind of Co-partenerſhip in the work of Creation. Chriſt alone, doth not make all things. But Chriſt, together with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, yet ſo as without the <hi>Word,</hi> without <hi>Chriſt</hi> was nothing made, by any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons. This wiſdome challengeth, as the Prerogative of the Son of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. from the 27 verſ. to the 31. <hi>When He prepared the Heavens, I was there; when He ſet a compaſſe upon the face of the deep, and ſtabliſhed the Clouds above, when He gave to the Sea his decree; then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him, and was daily His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, rejoycing alwayes before Him.</hi> It excludeth onely Creatures, not the Co-operation of the other Perſons in the Trinity, to what was made, <hi>without Him was not any thing made.</hi> It is an uſuall diſtinction amongſt Divines, God hath two ſorts of works, ſome <hi>Opera ad intra,</hi> works terminated upon ſome Perſon in the Trinity, <hi>works within.</hi> And theſe are done by ſome one perſon, not by another. So the Father <hi>begetteth.</hi> That work is terminated upon the Son, he is begotten, the ſon begetteth not. The Holy Ghoſt proceedeth, the Father doth not. That is a proper work, <hi>Adintra.</hi> But works <hi>Adextra.</hi> Works without God. And theſe are all common to all the three Perſons. The Father createth, and the Son createth, and the Holy Ghoſt createth, and yet but one <hi>Creator,</hi> becauſe it is a work that proceedeth from the Will of God, and the will of God is the ſame in all the three Perſons, and accordingly, though the work be aſcribed to every Perſon, yet they make but one Creator, becauſe all Three have but one Eſſence. But becauſe, they have different Subſiſtencies, the Father a diſtinct Perſon from the Son, and the Son from the Holy Ghoſt, therefore, they have a diſtinct manner of working, even in this buſineſſe of the Creation. In all things, the Father works. All mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168769:35"/> of <hi>Inchoations</hi> are aſcribed to the Father, of <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> to the Sonne; of <hi>Conſummations,</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt. But I will no longer dwell upon that: you ſee the meaning of theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Let us now come to apply them. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> that is, by <hi>Chriſt, and without him was not any thing</hi>

Three Inſtructions, four Conſolations, and five Directions I ſhall give you from this truth, That Chriſt is the Creator of all things, and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him was made nothing, that was made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It inſtructeth concerning the Divinity of Chriſt, which is the very end for which they bring this argument. The builder of all things is God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4. Chriſt was the builder of all things, ſaith my Text. Therefore Chriſt is God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the beginning, God Created Heaven and Earth, and Sea, and all therein,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt created Heaven, and Earth, and the Sea, ſaith my <note place="margin">Syllogiſm.</note> Text.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Chriſt is God.</p>
                  <p>To bring things together that are infinitly diſtant requireth an infinite power.</p>
                  <p>The diſtance which is between Beeing and No-beeing is infinite.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, He muſt needs be God that can bring all things out of nothing; and he that Createth, doth ſo.</p>
                  <p>This exalteth God above all Idolls. None of them can make a World. So the Apoſtle argueth, Act. 14. <hi>to turn them from Idolls to the living God.</hi> 15. verſ. <hi>We are men of like paſſion with you, and preach to you, that you ſhould turn from theſe Idolls to the living God, which made Heaven, and earth, and all things therein. Justin Martyr</hi> quoteth two Greek verſes out of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> to prove there is but one God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> If any will aſſume to himſelf, and ſay, <hi>I am God,</hi> except onely one, let him lay ſuch a Worid as this is to ſtake, and ſay, This World is mine;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168769:35"/> then I will believe him, otherwiſe not. He is God that made the World. Chriſt made the World. Therefore he is God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It inſtructeth us concerning the Excellency <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Chriſt above all things. <hi>By him were all things made.</hi> Therefore he himſelf muſt needs be better then all things, for he made them. The <hi>cauſe</hi> is better then the <hi>effect.</hi> The <hi>Carpenter</hi> better than the <hi>houſe,</hi> and the <hi>Shipright</hi> then the <hi>ſhip.</hi> Look whatſoever excellency is in the Creature it <note place="margin">All creature, excellency is from Chriſt.</note> came from Chriſt. Therefore he hath a greater excellency, than the Creature hath. Yea whatſoever are in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they meet in Chriſt. Therefore it is, that there are names borrowed from all the moſt excellent Creatures, to decipher Chriſt by, in Scripture; to ſhew that all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies are eminently in Him, from whom they have their beeing. Amongſt things in earth, that have barely a beeing, the moſt excellent are <hi>Jewells,</hi> and pretious <hi>Stones;</hi> Chriſt taketh a name from thence. He is called the <hi>Corner-ſtone, elect, &amp; pretious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. So, Iſa. 28. he is <hi>the great pretious ſtone,</hi> the Jewell of Jewells. Amongſt Vegetables, Plants, and Trees, the moſt excellent is the <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Olive: Chriſt is the true Vine,</hi> Joh. 15. <hi>and the good Olive-tree,</hi> Rom. 11. Amongſt Beaſts that have ſenſe, the moſt excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt wild Beaſts is the <hi>Lion,</hi> and amongſt tame Beaſts the <hi>Lamb:</hi> Chriſt taketh name from theſe; <hi>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. <hi>The Lion of the tribe of Judah,</hi> as in the Revelations.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, if ye look up into Heaven, the moſt excellent Quality is the Light, the moſt excellent Luminary is the Sun: Chriſt hath names from both theſe, <hi>This is the true light, that lighteneth every man that commeth into the world.</hi> And, <hi>The Sun of Righteouſneſſe, with healing under his wings,</hi> Mal. 4. So as it ſheweth to us, in the ſecond place, the excellency of Chriſt above all things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It inſtructeth us, concerning the primitive good <note place="margin">3. Chriſt ſo good, as to make nothing ill.</note> of all the Creatures; they are all of Chriſt's making, and therefore muſt needs be good; good in themſelves, and good to us. For he is ſo good, as that he can make nothing ill. He beareth ſuch affection to us, as that he will do us no
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168769:36"/> harm. He that in fulneſſe of time, was made for us of a Woman, made under the Law, will make all things uſefull for us that he undertakes to create. It is true, many things are now become hurtfull to man; Whence commeth this? Not from Chriſt. It is ſaid by <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the end of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>God looked upon the works of his creation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they were all good.</hi> If any thing be evill now in the end of the world, we may thank our ſelves and the Devill for that; for they came all good from Chriſt. Therefore let not us play the <hi>Balaam,</hi> and beat the Aſſe, when we are in the fault, as he did. <hi>Jude</hi> telleth you, verſ. 15, 16. of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, (and the world is full of them) that are Murmurers and Complainers, men that alwaies find fault with what God hath made their lot. This very conſideration might help us to complain of our ſelves, not of God, not of the Creator. As Phyſitians ſometimes do, when a man blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth exceſſively at the noſe, they open a vein in the arme to divert the blood. If we will be complaining, here is a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <note place="margin">Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint ſhould onely be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, not againſt God.</note> we ſhould complain of our ſinne, that hath brought all this miſery; kill ſinne, and all is good. Nothing more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, then for a man to deal with God, as <hi>Hiram</hi> did with <hi>Solomon.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13. It is there ſaid, <hi>that</hi> Solomon <hi>gave</hi> Hiram <hi>twenty Citties in the land of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and he came out from</hi> Tyre <hi>to ſee the Citties which</hi> Solomon <hi>had given him, and they pleaſed him not; and he ſaid, What Citties are theſe, which thou haſt given me? and he called them, the land of</hi> Cabul <hi>to this day;</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>Dirty. Solomon</hi> had beſtowed Cities upon <hi>Hiram,</hi> and in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they ſtood in very fertile places: only they had this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencie with their fertility, they were <hi>Mire</hi> and <hi>Dirty,</hi> therefore he was diſpleaſed at them. God hath beſtowed many bleſſings upon us; and yet, if there be any dirt goeth along with the fruit, (many times the fatteſt ſoile is lyable to that,) we are apt to call them <hi>Cabul,</hi> never looking at God that gave them. Let us remember that all creatures, as they came from God, are good. Therefore if we will be finding fault, find fault with our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the Conſolations. <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, here is matter of Comfort in caſe of the want of the <note place="margin">Of Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in caſe of Want.</note>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:168769:36"/> Creatures. When men are deſtitute either of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ot ſpirituall bleſſings that belong to the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Let them ſolace themſelves in this, Though the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be wanting, if faith be not wanting, they have Chriſt that made them all, and they may have the comforts of all in Him. Thus the Pſalmiſt comforteth himſelf in ſuch a caſe, Pſal. 146. 5, 6. He had ſaid before, <hi>Put not your truſt in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor in the ſons of men, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to the earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh againſt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the greateſt men, <hi>Princes,</hi> they are gone. What fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth? <note place="margin">Man's happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, and not in Man.</note> 
                     <hi>Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God, who made heaven, and earth, and the ſea, and all that is therein.</hi> When creatures fail, and men are wanting, Happy is he that truſteth in God, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Beloved, God himſelf is All-ſufficient, and needeth not the help of any creature; therefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made all theſe things for Himſelf: that is clear. For, if he had need, How could he have endured to be without them, till within theſe 5672 years. I ſay, If God had need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them himſelf, he would not have been without them till then. Therefore, certainly, he made them for ſome other end. Not for his enemies; his friends have an intereſt in them. If Chriſt made all theſe things, he made them with a ſpeciall reference to them, that have the greateſt intereſt in his favour. Therefore diſpair not. For God hath promiſed to with-hold no good thing from them, that walk uprightly. I ſpeak now of temporall bleſſings: It is much more true of ſpiritualls. That which is good, and good for me at this time, I ſhall have it, God will not with-hold it. He may indeed with-hold ſomething that is good, but, it may be, it is not good at this time, or in this eſtate I am in. Water is good, one of the moſt uſefull Elements; but not for a man in the heighth of a Feavour, though good for him at another time. None of thoſe things that God hath made, will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from his ſervants, when they are fitted to receive them. Ye have a great experience of this, how God provided for his Apoſtles in this caſe, in the want of the creatures, Luk. 22. 35. Chriſt ſaith to the Diſciples, <hi>When I ſent you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:168769:37"/> 
                     <hi>purſe, or ſcrip, and ſhoos, lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, Nothing.</hi> Here were men as poorly provided for, as one could imagine, ſent to travell without any ſhoos up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their feet. Here is want of apparell without. No meat <note place="margin">Believers want nothing, that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for their ſupport.</note> they could carry along with them. When I ſent you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcrip, and without any mony to buy any food or rayment with; I ſent you without purſe, as well as without food or ſhoos: And yet, lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The Maker of all things ſo diſpoſed, that though they carried nothing with them, they had ſome that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed all things upon them, that were neceſſary. As that reverend Divine, <hi>Vrfine,</hi> whoſe <hi>Catechiſm</hi> you have amongſt you at this day, was frequently heard to uſe this expreſſion, being a poor youth, <hi>I had many and many a time lyen in the ſtreets, if the Providence of God had not been mine Hoſte, taken me in, and given me a lodging.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well; But are they ſpirituall bleſſings that thou wanteſt? <note place="margin">All wants of ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Chriſt.</note> All theſe thou maiſt have from the Creator of all things, if thou believeſt. Doſt thou want Grace? Fetch it from him: <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O Lord, and renew a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 10. Doſt thou want Peace, peace of Conſcience? Have ye that? Whence commeth it? Chriſt, who is the Creator of all things, is the Creator of that; <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Go then to Chriſt, as the <hi>Centurion</hi> did, when his ſervant was ſick, and ſay, <hi>Speak the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole:</hi> Lord, ſpeak the word, and my ſoul ſhall be whole. It is but as at the Creation, <hi>He ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> Lord, let there be light in my underſtanding, and there ſhall be light: Let there be peace in my conſcience, and there ſhall be peace there. It is as eaſie for him to make thee righteous, as to make thee at firſt. Therefore truſt Him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is comfort in caſe of Scruple, about right to the Creature, which is a very uſuall caſe, and that many <note place="margin">2. In caſe of Scruple.</note> times with the deareſt ſervants of God. They think, they have no right to the leaſt bit of bread they put into their mouths; and therefore ſome have ſtarved themſelves, out of ſcruple. Who is the maker of all theſe things? Is not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:168769:37"/> Chriſt? and art not thou his? <hi>All are yours, if you be Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi> The Apoſtle reſolveth that caſe clearly, 1 Cor. 3. latter end, <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or principalityes, or powers, or things preſent, or</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">They that have Chriſt, have all.</note> 
                     <hi>things to come; all are yours, and ye are Chriſt's.</hi> If ye be Chriſt's, all are yours. Whatſoever queſtion may be made, of what right unregenerate men, out of Chriſt, have to the creature; yet, it is out of all queſtion, thou, that art a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, haſt a right. The ungodly have the right of a ſervant, but thou haſt the right of a ſon. Take this compariſon. A <note place="margin">Simile.</note> maid-ſervant, while ſhe liveth in a family, hath a right to the good things of that houſe; but now, put caſe, (as it often happeneth) that the Maſter of the family marry that Maid, and make her his wife; ſhe hath a farther right now to the ſame things, an higher right, and a more comfortable right than before. So, when a ſoul commeth once to be married to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to have a ſanctified uſe of all the creatures, as part of her Joynture; <hi>All is yours, and ye are Chriſt's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is Comfort, in caſe of fearing harm from the Creature. Are they not all of thy Saviour's making? <note place="margin">3. In caſe of fearing harm from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> are they not all thy Father's ſervants! Shall a ſon and heir be afraid to converſe in his Father's own family, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thoſe that ſerve him, whom he calleth Father? The creatures are more; they are not onely ſervants to Chriſt, but they owe their beeing to Chriſt. Ye ſee, great men, when they raiſe men, they are wont to call ſuch a one their <hi>Creature.</hi> What are the ſervants of the family? have they been raiſed up from nothing by the Maſter of the family, and ſhall the ſon fear to be amongſt them? <hi>I will lift up mine eyes to the hills, from whence commeth my help. My help ſtandeth in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</hi> He ſpeaketh nothing of help from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe he truſted in the Lord that made them. Ye have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 16, 17. God himſelf ſuggeſteth this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his people, <hi>Behold, I have created the ſmith, that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for his work. And I have created the deſtroyer to deſtroy. No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Therefore fear not. He that made all theſe things, hath
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168769:38"/> them at his command; and if he ſpeaks the word, they ſhall do thee no harm. <hi>Without him was nothing made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him can nothing hurt.</hi> If God ſpeaketh a word in a dream to <hi>Laban,</hi> and ſaith concerning <hi>Jacob,</hi> Hurt him not; <hi>Laban</hi> ſhall have no power to do him miſchief, when God rebuketh him. If God ſay to the creatures, even when they are armed againſt us, as <hi>David</hi> to the Captains, when they went out againſt <hi>Abſolom,</hi> See ye do the young man no harm; Plague, Fire, Sword, ſee ye do no hurt to him, they ſhall not be able to do any.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, here is comfort in caſe of parting with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as we muſt all do at death. Conſider, how mean they <note place="margin">4. In caſe of parting with the Creatures</note> are. I do but go at Death, if I am a Believer, from inferiour beeings, to the ſuperiour Beeing; leave the creature, but go to the Creator of all things, to Him that putteth all the goodneſſe, all the ſweetneſſe, into the creatures, which I find in them, or can expect from them; and hath infinitely more goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe in himſelf. Shall I then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a <hi>Loſſe</hi> by death? No, I ſhall be a <hi>Gainer:</hi> I leave the Stream and Rivolets, and go into the vaſt Ocean of all bliſſe and comfort. Shall a man that hath wandred and travelled all night by Star-light, which can hardly help him to ſee his way, complain, when the Sun ariſeth, that is a better guid? All the creatures, they are but Stars, they cannot all make <note place="margin">Our great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by dying in the Lord.</note> a day; put them altogether, it is but a dimn light you have from thence. Let no man complain, that he is hardly dealt withall, that dyeth in Chriſt; then the Sun riſeth, and he ſhall go to a higher light; from the fruition of the creature, to Him that made him, even to God himſelf. Therefore he may <hi>comfortably commit his ſoul to God, as to a faithfull Creator,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. Becauſe God will find his own Image upon that ſoul, and accordingly will own it for his own. He may comfortably commit his body to the grave, in aſſurance of the Reſurrection, upon this ground, becauſe Chriſt made all things; and he that made the body of man out of the duſt, can raiſe the body of man out of the duſt. Our remainders after death cannot be ſo little, as our beeing was before the world. Cannot that God, who fetched all things out of nothing, repair our bodies out of ſomething,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:168769:38"/> out of aſhes, out of duſt? Therefore when a man moſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth comfort, here is conſolation from hence, even in caſe of parting with the creatures at death. Ye have had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Conſolations.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Directions, in point of Practiſe; and of them briefly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seeing Chriſt is the Creator of all things, and not <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>1</label> any one thing was made without him, Learn we from <note place="margin">To fear God, the Creator of all things.</note> hence, Firſt, to ſtand in awe of him, upon this ground. Pſal. 33. 6, 7, 8. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſtes of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the depths in a ſtore-houſe. Let all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world fear him.</hi> All muſt fear him, becauſe he made all. If they were at his making, then they muſt be diſpoſed of by him. As we carry our ſelves to Chriſt, ſo ſhall the creatures carry themſelves to us, ſerviceably; or, if we walk contrary to him, no wonder if we find the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures walking contrary to us. Amos. 3. 12, 13. <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will I do to thee, O Iſrael. And becauſe I will do this to thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael. For lo, he that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mountains, and created the winds, that dwelleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high places of the earth; the Lord of hoſts is his name.</hi> He created all, therefore prepare to meet him in a way of fear and reverence; becauſe, if the Creator of all things be offended at us, he will arm all things againſt us; it is but giving the creature a commiſſion, and how ſoon is man deſtroyed? If Chriſt ſay, Take him, Plague, and conſume him; take him, Fire, and burn him; take him, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and drown him; Earth, open, and ſwallow him; Hell, be inlarged, and diſpatch him; it muſt be ſo. Therefore ſtand in awe of him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Learn we from hence, to commit our ſouls <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>2</label> to him in well-doing, as to a faithfull Creator. That ye <note place="margin">To commit our ſouls to him, as to a faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> have, 1 Pet. 4. ult. <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their ſouls to him in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, as to a faithfull Creator.</hi> If a Watch had underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, doubtleſſe, it would commit the keeping of it ſelf to none, but to him that made it; becauſe when it is out of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168769:39"/> frame, he beſt knoweth how to ſet it right again, becauſe it is his own workmanſhip, therefore he will have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to it, than any other man will have. Chriſt hath been the Creator of our ſouls, let him have the keeping of them; <hi>Caſt all your care upon him, for he careth for you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> Shall not he that made thee, be able to keep thee? Doth not the Artificer love the work of his own hands? He that hath given ſo much power to many creatures (as to the Angels) hath he not reſerved much more power to himſelf, who is able to keep, and to keep to ſalvation? <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God, through faith, to ſalvation.</hi> How ſecure do men think themſelves, if ſome excellent creatures do but take care of them? Suppoſe a great Prince ſhould ſay to any of us, that have a great many children, Take no care for ſuch and ſuch a child, ſend him to me, I will take care for him; How would ſuch a perſon think himſelf at reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that child? With what ſecurity may we build upon the love of God in Chriſt, if we commit our ſouls to him in well-doing, as to a faithfull Creator.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Learn we to get an intereſt in him, as a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; otherwiſe, we ſhall have no more ſhew for Salvation, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>3</label> than the brute beaſts have, for he is their Creator as well as <note place="margin">To get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him as a Redeemer</note> ours; <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> He gave life to other creatures as well as to man. Believe it, whoſoever thou art, an Ox or an Aſſe may be ſaved, as well as a Man or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if that Man or Woman will not believe in Chriſt. Thou art the workmanſhip of his hands; true, ſo is the brute beaſt. It is not enough to be Chriſt's creatures, we muſt be Chriſt's Members before we can get to Heaven. Do not ſay, He that madens will ſave us. What ſaith the Prophet? Iſa. 27. 11. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy upon them, and he that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them will ſhew them no favour.</hi> It is not our being framed creatures by Chriſt, but his framing the new creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, to help us in the way to Heaven. Give up your ſelves to Prayer, as <hi>David</hi> doth, Pſal. 119. 73. <hi>Thine hands, O Lord, have made and faſhioned me; give me underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I may learn to keep thy commandments.</hi> He reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in his being made by God, but, <hi>Give me underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep thy commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:168769:39"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, ſeeing all things were made by Chriſt, Learn <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>4</label> from hence to conſider the works of the Creation. It is a <note place="margin">To conſider the works of the Creation with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> diſhonour to Chriſt, to have the works of the Creation neglected, and no man to look after them in a way of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. As it would be a diſhonour to a curious <hi>Poet,</hi> that hath framed an excellent Comedy, and brought it upon the Stage, to have no ſpectators. God hath laid out a great deal of his Wiſdom in the works of the world, and calleth upon men to behold the works of his hands; How ill will he take it, if we conſider them not. If he hangeth out ſuch a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece</hi> as the world is, and we go as ſwine, and never behold it, we do much neglect the Lord. See how ill the Lord taketh it, and how ill men fare, and from this very ſin, Pſal. 28. 5. <hi>Becauſe they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operations of his hands, he ſhall deſtroy them, and not build them up.</hi> He will deſtroy them for want of conſidering the works of his hands.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Seeing Chriſt is the Maker of all things, Let all be improved in his ſervice to his praiſe; that is the end he <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>5</label> 
                     <note place="margin">To be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, to his praiſe.</note> made them for. Rev. 4. ult. <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power, for thou haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things.</hi> He is worthy to receive honour and glory, becauſe he created all things. Col. 1. 16. <hi>All things were created by him, and for him.</hi> Not onely <hi>by him,</hi> as the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient;</hi> but <hi>for him,</hi> as the <hi>End.</hi> Therefore we ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſtrength, and parts, and means: whatſoever we have, employ it to the ſervice of Chriſt, becauſe from him we had it. Take along with you this Rule, <hi>That is a vain thing that miſſeth its end. That is a curſed thing that croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth its end.</hi> That which miſſeth its end, which it was made for, is a vain thing. For inſtance, Chriſt hath given me a tongue to glorifie him withall; I have my tongue in vain, if I do not ſpeak of Chriſt with it; as <hi>David</hi> did, who made his tongue as the Pen of a ready Writer. But, if I ſhall not onely ſpeak of Chriſt, but againſt him, blaſpheme him, deny his Divinity, and Satisfaction, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do; here is a curſe upon my tongue, here it croſſeth the end of its crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo it is, when a man employeth his wits to ſcoff againſt God and goodneſſe with it; when he groweth proud
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168769:40"/> of his wealth, or parts, or apparell, or any thing that God hath given him; when he abuſeth his ſtrength to intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or luxury. Here the end of his Making is croſſed, and here is a curſe upon his parts and all other gifts; his bleſſings are a curſe to him. I conclude with Col. 3. 17. <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</hi> So I have done with the third Verſe, and proceed to the fourth.</p>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="verse">
               <head>Verſ. 4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>An Argument of Chriſt's Divinity, taken from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſidered in generall, in the making of all things. He commeth now to ſpeak more ſpecially, of things that have life; and then more particularly of Himſelf, and Man, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three degrees of Communications there are from Chriſt, as a Creator, <hi>Eſſe, Vivere, Intelligere.</hi> To ſome things he giveth a beeing, as to <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> to other things he giveth life as well as beeing, as to <hi>Plants,</hi> and <hi>Birds,</hi> and <hi>Fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Beaſts;</hi> ſome whereof have the life of <hi>Vegetation,</hi> others, both of <hi>Vegetation</hi> and of <hi>Senſe.</hi> And then there is a third degree of Communication, that is, <hi>Intelligere, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> that God giveth to men and Angels. Of the firſt degree, he had ſpoken before; of all things that are made in generall: now he ſpeaketh in ſpeciall manner of the ſecond degree of communication, which is giving of life to all the creatures; that is in theſe words,</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>In Him was Life.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In Him;</hi> namely, in the <hi>Word.</hi> For he had ſpoken, that <note place="margin">Life in Chriſt. two manner of waies.</note> in Chriſt, life was two waies, <hi>Formaliter,</hi> and <hi>Cauſaliter.</hi> Life was Formally in Chriſt, as in the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. Life was Cauſally in Chriſt, as in the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Ye may give me leave to ſpeak of both, though the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, haply, be principally intended. <hi>In him was life,</hi> as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168769:40"/> in the <hi>Subject</hi> of it. Take from hence an Obſervation, <hi>That</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. As in the Subject. 2. As in the Fountain.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt ever liveth, and is the giver of all life.</hi> He ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, life is in him, as the Subject. He is the giver of all life, life is in him as the Fountain.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He ever liveth;</hi> that is, He is the living God; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, Joh. 5. 26. <hi>As the Father hath life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> There was no time wherein Chriſt did not live, he liveth from all eternity, had life in himſelf, even as the Father had. If any queſtion be, it muſt be at that time, wherein his Soul was parted from the Body, when the Body lay in the grave? Yet even then, Chriſt lived. One of his laſt words upon the Croſſe, was to the Thief, <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> He had his Soul and Divinity in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, even while his Body lay, and was houſed in the Grave. Chriſt lived in Heaven, though his ſoul parted for a time from the Body; neither was the <hi>Hypoſtaticall union</hi> diſſolved. So, the life was not loſt.</p>
                  <p>But the main thing intended is the Second, <hi>In him was life (Cauſally)</hi> as in the Fountain of life. When he created all things, life was originally in him, and from him derived to certain creatures, which he then made. Hence it is, that Chriſt is called, <hi>The Word of life, The Prince of life, The Life of life.</hi> Becauſe, as he is the End, ſo he communicates life to all things that partake of it. He is called <hi>The Word of life,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 1. <hi>which we have lookt upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of life.</hi> He is called, <hi>The Prince of life,</hi> Act. 3. 15. <hi>They killed the Prince of life, whom God raiſed from the dead, whereof we are witneſſes.</hi> He calleth himſelf, <hi>The Life,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. <hi>I am the War, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> And becauſe his is not onely life in himſelf, but life to us, therefore he is called, <hi>Our Life,</hi> Col. 3. 4. <hi>When Chriſt, who is Our Life, ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> All this is to ſhew, that whatſoever life is communicated to the creature, it commeth from Chriſt, it is in him as in the Fountain, <hi>With thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 9.</p>
                  <p>So as here now, in conſideration of this, it may be of Uſe to us diverſe waies; as,</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:168769:41"/>
                  <p> Firſt, Take it to pieces again, <hi>In him was life,</hi> as in the <note place="margin">1. In Chriſt is Life as in the Subject, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</note> 
                     <hi>Subject.</hi> This ſhould ſerve as a Canon to fear, which we find called for in <hi>Daniel,</hi> in this reſpect, Dan. 6, 26. <hi>I make a decree,</hi> ſaith <hi>Darius, that in every dominion of my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God.</hi> Let all fear and tremble before Chriſt, for in him is life, he is the living God. What ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 10. 31. <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> O therefore, tremble before him. There are hands of God, into which it is a comfortable thing to fall. There are mercifull hands of Chriſt, which he ſtretcheth forth to poor ſinners, to invite them, and call them in to himſelf: but if we refuſe the Call which he now maketh to us; if all the benefits, which thoſe bountifull hands of his ſpread out amongſt us, ſcattered in our Congregations, and in our Houſes; if all theſe allure us not, then remember what followeth, <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God:</hi> one will follow upon the other. If this mercifull hand cannot win us, this deſtroying hand will be ſure to reach us. This maketh it fearfull, becauſe His is the living God. Every death is the more fearfull, by how much the more terrible the immediate Executioner of it is. For a man to be drowned is more gentle, than to be burnt; Why? Becauſe Water is not ſo operative, and active, and quick, as Fire; Fire is a more raging element. The wrath of God is the immediate Executioner of damned ſouls. And what ſo terrible as that is? If God live, ſuch ſouls muſt die. And becauſe God liveth for ever, ſuch ſouls muſt die for ever, as fall into his revengefull hands. Fear and tremble to offend Chriſt, becauſe ſuch as fall into the hands of the living God, muſt be miſerable as long as he is happy; and die, as long as he liveth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The conſideration of this truth, That in Chriſt is life, as in a Fountain, from whence all ſorts of life are <note place="margin">He is Life as in the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, therefore truſt him, ſeek him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him.</note> derived to the creatures, according to their ſeverall kinds, may ſerve as a ground of faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to put us upon truſting in Chriſt, and ſeeking to him, and depending upon him for all kinds of life: Pſal. 36. 7th. and 9th. verſes compared together, <hi>The children of men</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:168769:41"/> 
                     <hi>put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy wings,</hi> verſ. 7. and the reaſon is rendred, verſ. 9. <hi>For with thee is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life.</hi> Therefore our truſt ſhould be in him, becauſe life is in him, as in the Fountain. Whither ſhould he, that wanteth water, go, but to the Fountain? Carry Faith, as the Bucket; and then, according to the bigneſſe of thy buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, ſhall be the proportion of thy water thou draweſt from thence. Life commeth in, as Faith draweth from Chriſt. Truſt him for temporall life, when we are ſick, and in dangers; though means may be uſed, and ought to be uſed, there is no relying upon Phyſick. Our utmoſt confidence muſt be in him, from whom all life commeth. Deut. 32. 39. I, <hi>even I am he, and there is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</hi> And ſo for ſpirituall life: when the pulſe of Grace beateth ſlowly, and unevenly, Who ſhall we then depend upon for life, but upon him that is the fountain of it, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whom God hath made a quickning Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it may be a ground of Faith at all times, ſo <note place="margin">2. Therefore a ground of Martyrdom.</note> a ground of Martyrdom at any time, when a man is called, to ſeal the truth of his profeſſion with his blood. Now this being conſidered, that life is in Chriſt as in the Fountain, and derived from him to us; this is a ſpeciall ground to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the ſoul, to ſuffer it ſelf, even to be laid down for Chriſt. Now he calleth for that life, which he himſelf firſt gave; we had it from him, and now we are called to reſtore it to him: the beſt husbandry that can be. But to be provident of our lives in this caſe, and to be over-thrifty, is the way never to thrive, as Chriſt ſaith, Mar. 8. 35. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it. Whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake and the Goſpel's, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi> It is no ſuch great matter: Life is as common to brute beaſts as to men; and therefore when Chriſt calleth for it, there is reaſon to part from it, becauſe he gave it. It muſt be given up as a tribute to Nature. What is it to part with it a little ſooner, as a ſacrifice to Chriſt, as a ſeal of our profeſſion, and as a pledge of our thankfulneſſe? It is not ſo much part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it, as reſtoring it to the Owner.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:168769:42"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, it may ſerve as a ground of Encouragement. Life <note place="margin">3. Therefore a ground of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</note> is in Chriſt as in the Fountain, therefore let all that wait upon Chriſt be encourag'd to expect life in abundance. A great deal of complaining there is of dead hearts, and dull ſpirits; no life in the ſoul, in duty or ſervice. Exerciſe Faith, go to the Fountain for all, and you ſhall have life, and have it in abundance. Chriſt doth not uſe to give niggardly, when he is ſued to. It is ſaid of <hi>Araunah, All th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah gave as a King. Chriſt</hi> giveth as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> in this very particular, Joh. 10. 10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> He giveth ſo, as to give it in abundance. It will not be amiſſe to ſpend ſome time, in clearing of that, that Chriſtians may go away with encouragement. Whether we ſpeak of the ſeverall ſorts of life, of Spirituall life, (for I will not ſpeak of Naturall) or to the ſeverall bleſſings, that accompany every ſort of ſpirituall life, which is all derived from one fountain. I take them together, that I may ſpeak the more briefly of them.</p>
                  <p>There are five ſorts of Spirituall life, which are proper to Saints; beſides a Naturall life, which is common to all <note place="margin">Five ſorts of Spiritual life.</note> men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is a life of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> which ſtandeth in <note place="margin">1. A life of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi>
                     </note> oppoſition to the wrath of God. The wrath of God, that killeth, <hi>but in the favour of God there is life,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 30. 5. <hi>Thy anger endureth but for a moment, but in thy favour is life.</hi> This life is from Chriſt, becauſe it is he in whom he is well-pleaſed, and through whom he is well pleaſed with us: <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> If any Reconciliation, it is in Chriſt. Here is one ſort of ſpirituall life that Chriſt giveth, and that in abundance; <hi>I came that they might have life, and have it more abundantly;</hi> becauſe, where God is reconciled, he beareth abundance of good-will to ſuch a ſoul. <hi>In thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is life;</hi> and that favour aboundeth ſo much, as that God loveth every reconciled ſoul with the ſame love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he loveth Chriſt himſelf; Joh. 17. 23. <hi>That the world may know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me,</hi> faith Chriſt. That ſheweth abundant love. All love falleth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168769:42"/> firſt upon Chriſt, as the head, Divine love doth; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth to the skirts of his garments. It falleth upon us from Chriſt, and through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a life of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> which ſtandeth <note place="margin">2. A life of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification.</hi>
                     </note> in oppoſition to the guilt of ſin; and of this the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, Rom. 5. and telleth you, what abundance of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe accompanyeth it, Rom. 5. 15, 17. <hi>If through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many. For if by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more they which receive abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of grace; and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is called, Juſtification of life, there, verſ. 18. <hi>Even ſo, by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men to Juſtification of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a life of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> that ſtandeth <note place="margin">3. A life of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</hi>
                     </note> in oppoſition to the power of ſin, as that of <hi>Juſtification</hi> did to the guilt of ſin. This is likewiſe from Chriſt; and of it <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, Gal. 2. latter end, <hi>I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live to the Lord. I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world, notwithſtanding I live; yet not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me.</hi> This commeth in from Chriſt in great abundance. Hence are thoſe expreſſions, 2 Cor. 8. 17. <hi>Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and all diligence, and your love towards us, ſee that ye abound in this grace alſo.</hi> Rom. 9. 8. <hi>God is able to make all grace abound towards you.</hi> This is that that Chriſt ſaith, That he giveth life, and more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is a life of <hi>Conſolation,</hi> which ſtandeth in oppoſition to the diſcouragements that ariſe, both from <note place="margin">4. A life of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</hi>
                     </note> the power of ſin, and the guilt of ſin, that ſtrike the ſoul dead. And therefore a ſoul that is glad, is ſaid to live; Pſal. 69. 32. <hi>The humble ſhall ſee this, and be glad, and your heart ſhall live.</hi> So you ſee, that to be glad, and to live, is all one. This is founded in Chriſt, and there is abundance of this communicated to believers. See that 1 Cor. 2. 15. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</hi> Here is conſolation, abundant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and both by Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:168769:43"/>
                  <p> The laſt thing is a life of <hi>Glory,</hi> which ſtandeth in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <note place="margin">5. A life of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
                     </note> to that miſery, that ariſeth from all the former, from the wrath of God, and the guilt and power of ſin, and the diſcouragements that ariſe from thence; all theſe bring mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery after the ſoul's death. Now, there is a life of Glory, that freeth the ſoul from this, that is hid in Chriſt: <hi>You are dead, but your life is hid with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory.</hi> There is a glorious life for believers, but it is now hidden, like the ſap in the root in the winter-time. It is hidden in Chriſt, who is their glorifi'd Head already. This they ſhall have, and have it more abundantly, becauſe of that aboundant happineſſe, which accompanieth this life of Glory, <hi>They ſhall be aboundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of thy houſe, and made to drink of the rivers of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. For with thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 8, 9. When there is but a little ſmall Brook, and a whole Army commeth to drink at it, they are ready to emulate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, becauſe there is not enough to ſerve them all. As he ſaid, <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Army drunk up whole Rivers. But where there are Rivers of pleaſure, there is enough for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; there needs be no emulation, all ſhall be ſatisfied: They ſhall be abundantly; and, Thou ſhalt cauſe them to drink of the Rivers of thy pleaſures. Thus ye ſee, what ſtrong Encouragement ariſeth from hence, that life is in Chriſt as in the Fountain. So I have done with that Clauſe of the fourth Verſe, <hi>In him was life.</hi> The next is,</p>
                  <q>And the Life was the Light of Men.</q>
               </div>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="verse">
               <head>Verſ. 5. <hi>And the Light ſhined in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>We proceed to that which concerneth the Creation of <note place="margin">Light of Life,</note> Men in particular, <hi>The life was the light of men.</hi> That is, as I take it, The Life which was originally in the Eternall Word, and conveyed to the creature, according to their ſeverall ranks and degrees, was a life of Vegetation in Plants, and a life of Senſe in Brutes, and a Life and Light of Men. It was ſo in the Angels as well as in Men. But
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168769:43"/> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> becauſe the Scripture was made for the uſe of Men, and not of Angels, contenteth himſelf onely to mention them; <hi>The life was the light of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Light,</hi> I am ſoath to underſtand onely <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as <note place="margin">is Knowledge Grace, and Joy.</note> ſome do; or onely <hi>Grace,</hi> as other ſome: I rather take in both, and add a third thing, which is the reſult of both, namely, <hi>Joy.</hi> For all theſe three come under the notion of Light. Then make this our Obſervation, <hi>That man was created by God at firſt in a ſtate of light: The life was the light of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do but compare this place with that, Joh. 8. 12. for the underſtanding of the phraſe; <hi>Then ſpake Jeſus again to them, ſaying, I am the light of the world. He that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life.</hi> The light of life, and the life of light, is all one, and both come from Chriſt, without any great difficulty. Next the life, was the light of men, <hi>And he ſhall have the life of light,</hi> ſaith Chriſt here; but that he ſpeaketh of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. My Text confineth me to what was in the Creation. Chriſt is preſented to us, as the Maker of all things. So then, Man was created by Chriſt at firſt in a ſtate of light; that is, in a ſtate of Knowledge, of Holineſſe, and of Joy; for theſe three things come under the notion of Light in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Knowledge.</hi> See in that 2 Cor. 4. 6. <hi>God, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> 
                  <hi>commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was eminently in Man, at his firſt creation. Therefore the light of God is ſaid to ſtand in knowledge; <hi>Having put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him.</hi> And whereas there are three ſorts of beams of light, by which the underſtanding ſeeth <note place="margin">Three ſorts of Beams of Light. <hi>Direct. Reflect. Refract.</hi>
                  </note> things; and theſe were all eminent in <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt Creation. There are <hi>Direct</hi> beams, and <hi>Reflect</hi> beams, and <hi>Refract</hi> beams, ſo they are wont to call them. Thus, a man ſeeth another man, whom he looketh upon face to face, by a <hi>direct</hi> beam. The ſame man, when he ſeeth his own face in a glaſſe, it is by a <hi>reflect</hi> beam. Let him look into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168769:44"/> ſee a ſtaff in the water; that is by a <hi>refract</hi> beam, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is broken, by reaſon of the thickneſſe of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Adam</hi>'s Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> the water, through which he ſeeth. Now, <hi>Adam</hi> ſaw by all theſe, and, by them, in a way of perfection: He lookt, by a <hi>direct</hi> beam of light, upon all the creatures; he ſaw the inſide and outſide of them; he knew all their Natures ſo plainly, as that he was able to give them all names, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſeverall kinds. He lookt upon himſelf by a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect</hi> beam of light, he was able to apprehend all his own notions and apprehenſions, and all the duties God required at his hands, and that without any oblivion; which, ſince the Fall, we cannot do. We have power to reflect, indeed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves; but what we do one day, we forget another. But now, with <hi>Adam,</hi> in this ſtate of light, he could neither forget evill, nor forget good. He could forget no evill, for there was no evill to forget; and he could forget no good, for it had been evill to have forgotten it, for he was without all evill. And then, for a <hi>Refract</hi> beam of light, he lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God with ſuch a beam, becauſe he ſaw God in them through a thick <hi>Medium.</hi> He could not ſee God in his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> but through the <hi>Medium</hi> of the creature, and through thoſe Revelations, which he was pleaſed to make of himſelf before the Fall. Herein ſtood that light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wherewith <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt created.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Man was created in a ſtate of <hi>Light;</hi> that is, in <note place="margin">2. Created in a ſtate of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</note> a ſtate of <hi>Holineſſe:</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 6, 7. <hi>If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another;</hi> that is, in <hi>Holineſſe. Ye were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now are ye light in the Lord:</hi> that is, <hi>holy,</hi> and ſanctified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Holineſſe was ſtamped upon <hi>Adam</hi> there, in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent meaſure; it was a deep ſtamp, and a clear one, becauſe the Image of God was not onely in <hi>knowledge,</hi> as before, but <hi>in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there was no irregularity in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul. He was an Inſtrument, new made by the finger of God himſelf, well ſtrung, and well tun'd, not a jarring ſtring in the whole In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. A Glaſſe filled with pure cryſtall-water, no mudd at the bottom, no defilement in the water, ſtand it never ſo much. His Body was ſubject to his Appetite, his Appetite
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168769:44"/> ſubject to his Will, his Will ſubject to his Reaſon, his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubject to God. One Faculty ſweetly ſubordinate to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and all to the <hi>Divine Majeſty. This I have found,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. ult.) <hi>that God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and that he hath ſought out many inventions.</hi> If man would have contented himſelf with that happineſſe, that God made him in at firſt, he might have been happy. He was at firſt created in light of Holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Man was created in a ſtate of <hi>Light;</hi> that is, of <note place="margin">3. Man crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in a ſtate of Joy.</note> 
                  <hi>Joy,</hi> which commeth under the notion of Light in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Heſt. 8. 16. <hi>The Jews had light, and gladneſſe, and joy, and honour. Light is ſowen for the righteous, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the upright in heart,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi> There was nothing wanting, to make <hi>Adam</hi>'s condition comfortable to him. For his Body, he had a Paradiſe; all the delights and pleaſures, that are found in all the ſeverall places of the world at this day, put together, they could not make ſuch a Garden as <hi>Eden</hi> was, nor ſuch a pleaſant place as <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> For his Soul, he enjoyed the chiefeſt good; the more he knew God, the more God loved him; and the more he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, the more he praiſed him; and the more he praiſed him, the more he delighted in him. There was overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of joy in <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſoul. Then, in reference to God, and ſo the Creatures; It could not but add exceedingly to the light of joy in <hi>Adam</hi>'s heart, that all the creatures were willingly ſubject to him. God had made him Maſter of them all, and not one of them that refuſed to be ſubject. Indeed, afterwards, ſince the Fall, the creatures became formidable to him. <hi>Moſes,</hi> when his Rod was turned into a Serpent, he fled from it, and was afraid; but ſo was not <hi>Eve,</hi> when the Serpent came to her in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> The Image of God was ſo perfectly ſtampt upon <hi>Adam</hi> then, that every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bare him reverence, and ſtood in awe of the face of Man. And ſo they did to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in whom the Image of God was fully renewed. That is a paſſage obſervable, though, haply, not much heeded, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 13. it is a clauſe brought in by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> which the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> (as I think) have not ſpoken of; <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>He was there forty daies tempted of Satan, and was</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:168769:45"/> 
                  <hi>with the wild beaſts of the field.</hi> The other tell you of his being tempted, but St. <hi>Mark</hi> onely putteth in theſe words, <hi>And he was with the wild beaſts,</hi> which was as great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle as any of the other. It was a miracle, that Chriſt faſted forty daies and nights; but it was as great a miracle, that all the beaſts did homage, and gave reverence to him, even as they had done to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Thus ye have heard, for Explication of this Truth, That Man was created at firſt, by Chriſt, in a ſtate of Light; that is, in a ſtate of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> of <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and of <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The Uſe ſhall be generall, to all the ſons and <note place="margin">1 Generall Uſe. To ſeek to Chriſt, to be reſtored to the ſtate of Light.</note> daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> that they would ſeek to Chriſt, that they may be reſtored to this ſtate of light. He, who himſelf is the Image of God, the expreſſe Image of his Father's Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. who at firſt made man after that Image of God; He onely it is that can reſtore him. He, from whom life was the light of men, he it is, that muſt give that light of life; and he hath promiſed to give it to ſuch as follow him. Certainly, this is worth the ſeeking after, Joh. 8. 12. <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life.</hi> That which we loſt in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhall have reſtored in the Second; there is no other way to come by it, but this. The <hi>Mint,</hi> in which <hi>Knowledge, Holineſſe,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> are coyned, it goeth in Heaven, and no where elſe: <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Maſter</hi> of that <hi>Mint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That you may be encouraged to ſeek to Chriſt for this, ſet me tell you, <hi>Beloved,</hi> That if the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be <note place="margin">1. Sweeter <hi>Knowledge</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then that we loſt in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </note> pleaſed to renew this Image in you, and reſtore you to this ſtate of <hi>light,</hi> you ſhall have a ſweeter Knowledge, ye ſhall have a ſurer Holineſſe, and a more laſting Joy, than <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf had in Paradiſe. The light that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> giveth, is better, in ſome reſpect, than the light which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt.</p>
               <p>Ye ſhall know that which <hi>Adam</hi> never knew, the heighth, and depth, and breadth, and length, of the love of God in Chriſt. That which did not come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s knowledge, to know what belonged to a Redeemer; but that is made known to the Saints, in whom
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168769:45"/> the Image of God is renewed: Epheſ. 3. 17, 18, 19. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth; and to know the love of God which paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulneſſe of God. Adam</hi> knew much of the love of God, as a <hi>Creator;</hi> but now, we know the love of God as a <hi>Redeemer.</hi> This muſt needs be a ſweeter knowledge, becauſe this ſecond is a greater love. The miſery of the perſon to whom love is ſhewed, heightneth the love. That which God, in Chriſt, <note place="margin">Pitty in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heightneth love.</note> ſheweth to man fallen, is love in mercy; love, joyned with mercy, is greater love, therefore the knowledge of this is ſweeter knowledge.</p>
               <p>And as ye ſhall have ſweeter Knowledge, ſo ſurer <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Surer <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
                  </note> I do not ſay, a purer Holineſſe: <hi>Adam</hi> was more pure in the ſtate of Innocency, than any man on this ſide Heaven; he had no corruptions ſtirring in him. But ſurer <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> That <hi>Holineſſe</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had, he was capable of loſing it, and did loſe it. That which Chriſt reſtoreth to them, in whom this Image is renewed, it is not left to their own keeping, He himſelf keepeth it for them, <hi>and no man ſhall take them out of his hand,</hi> Joh. 10. 28. <hi>They ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi> As it fareth ſometimes with a man that hath broke his leg or arm, if he light upon a good <hi>Chirurgion</hi> that ſetteth it well again, the arm or leg is ſtronger, than before the breaking of it; and we ſay, He fell into the hands of a good <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> So, we were broken in <hi>Adam,</hi> but we have by Chriſt a ſtronger Holineſſe, than we had at firſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo you ſhall have a more laſting <hi>Joy,</hi> than you could <note place="margin">3. More laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Joy.</hi>
                  </note> have in the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> It was a joyfull ſtate, as ye have heard, but how long endured it? The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Sorrow endureth for a night, but joy commeth in the morning.</hi> Here, <hi>joy</hi> endured for the morning, and <hi>ſorrow</hi> came at evening. Some think, <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſtand in his integrity a whole night; ſure, he did not ſtand long, but loſt his <hi>joy</hi> preſently. That <hi>joy</hi> which is given, to whom this Image is renewed, is ſuch, as no man or devill can take from them: Joh. 16. 22.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168769:46"/> 
                  <hi>You all ſhall rejoyce, and your joy ſhall no man t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>There is another more Particular, that is to ſuch, as are <note place="margin">Particular Uſe</note> reſtored to this Image of God, and a new ſtate of life, from which <hi>Adam</hi> ſell, that they might walk as children of the light. How is that? The Exhortation ye have, Epheſ. 5. 8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſſe, but now are ye light in the Lord; Walk as children of the light.</hi> That is, Walk know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, walk piouſly, walk cheerfully; for light includeth all theſe three.</p>
               <p>Hath Chriſt reſtored you to what ye fell from?</p>
               <p>Firſt then, <hi>Walk knowingly,</hi> have a care to ſee your way <note place="margin">1. Walk <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</hi>
                  </note> before you; whatſoever ye do, it upon warrantable and good grounds; take up no Opinion upon truſt, follow no Principles, without a warrant from the Scripture: <hi>He that walketh in darkneſſe,</hi> faith Chriſt, Joh, 12. 35. <hi>knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi> And ſo, Prov. 4. 19. <hi>The way of the wicked is as darkneſſe,</hi> they know not at what they ſtumble. So long as a man is in the dark, he knoweth not whither he goeth, nor at what he ſtumbleth; he reeleth ſometimes this way, and ſometimes that way, runneth his head againſt a poſt, or falleth into a ditch, into this error, or that. He ſtumbleth now upon a mad Principle, and then upon a bad Principle, becauſe he knoweth not whither he goeth. In the dark there is no diſcerning of colours, all things are alike fair. So it is with men in the ſtate of unregeneracy; there is no difference between civility and grace, between forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and truth, between faith and fancy. He that will walk as a child of light, muſt diſcern of things that differ; for, <hi>It is light that maketh manifeſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As he muſt walk knowingly, ſo <hi>Piouſly: Put on</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the armour of light, and let us walk</hi>

                  <hi>honeſtly as in the day,</hi> Rom. 13. 13. Would you know how? Caſt your eyes upon Epheſ. 5. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Walk as children of light. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe, and righteouſneſſe, and truth; proving what is acceptable to the Lord.</hi> This place ſheweth you, that the light of holineſſe,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168769:46"/> which is in the ſouls of the Saints, it is a <hi>Prolificall Light,</hi> which bringeth ſorth fruit: <hi>Walk as children of the light. For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and truth.</hi> It is the light of the Sun that beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth creatures, which the light of a Candle doth not. Many Creatures have no other father, but the Light, as <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> ſay, <hi>Putredo mater, Sol pater;</hi> Putridity is the mother, and the heat of the Sun, that is the father of them. So it is with all inferiour Lights, they are like the light of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the naturall light of Reaſon, and the utmoſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of naturall abilities; this light, make the beſt of it, till it come to be ſupernaturall, and to have infuſion from Chriſt, it hath no quickning power in it, it will not reform a man's life, it begets no work truly good. Whereas the light of <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> like the light of the Sun, it ingenders, and bringeth forth good works: <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then there will be a proving of what is acceptable to the will of God. Men will not go blind-fold to work, but will prove what is acceptable. The word in the Originall is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken from <hi>Goldſmiths,</hi> that prove their Mettle by the Touchſtone, not by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour onely, or <hi>tinnitu,</hi> by the jingling of the Mettle onely; but bring it to the Teſt: if it will not bear that, they diſallow it. Many things have a fair colour to the eye, that ſeem good and beautifull, fit to be practiſed by a Chriſtian; and ſome things that ſound well to the ear, as of good report in the world: but here is not enough, bring them to the Teſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve neither colour nor ſound, if they will not bear the touchſtone of the Word; A man that walketh holily will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the proof it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that walketh as a child of light, muſt <hi>walk Cheerfully,</hi> for there is a light of Joy too. Such a phraſe ye <note place="margin">3. Walk <hi>Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi>
                  </note> have in the Pſalms, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſound, they ſhall walk in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Here is now one walking as a child of light, that walketh in the light of God's countenance <hi>cheerfully</hi> and <hi>joyfully. Serve the Lord with gladneſs, and come into his preſence with ſinging,</hi> Pſal. 100. 2. This is acceptable to God,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168769:47"/> and creditable to Religion. God liketh it well, that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould walk in the light of his countenance <hi>joyfully.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth you, this is acceptable to God, Rom. 14. 17, 18. <hi>The kingdom of God ſtandeth not in meat and drink; but in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> He that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of men. This is one of the things wherein we muſt ſerve Chriſt; <hi>joyfully, in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Chriſt doth not like to be ſerved uncheerfully. They that make conſcience of ſerving Chriſt in righteouſneſſe, and of ſerving Chriſt in peace, dare not be the Authors of diviſion. Why do not people make conſcience of ſerving Chriſt, in joy too? He that in theſe things, namely, in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy, ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of men. The Saints of God like it well, when they ſee men go chearfully on in the way to heaven; otherwiſe, they bring a bad report upon the good Land, and make men to ſuſpect, that the ſervice of Chriſt is not ſo acceptable, when men walk ſo droopingly, that ſtand in relation to him. You know what <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ahab,</hi> who had a mind to <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; and becauſe he could not compaſſe it, <hi>he walked droopingly. She came to him, and ſaid, Why is thy ſpirit ſo ſad? Doſt thou now govern the</hi>

What! a King, and droop! One that hath ſuch a nearneſſe, and ſo near a relation to God, and yet ſo full of diſcontent! Let me yet ſay to every child of God, as the Apoſtle, Phil. 5. 4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies: and again I ſay, Rejoyce.</hi> So I have now done with that Verſe, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi>

                  <p>Here ye have a ſuppoſall of Man's Fall, and a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168769:48"/> both of man's carriage towards him, and of his carriage towards Chriſt ſince the Fall. I ſhall but touch upon the firſt, which is this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Man fell from a ſtate of light, and became dark, yea, darkneſſe it ſelf. Light was the life of men, by Creation, and ſince, the light ſhineth in darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>darkneſs,</hi> underſtand the perſons of <hi>unregenerate</hi> men; all the world, before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt enlightneth them ſavingly, with the light of life, come under this notion of darkneſſe. Therefore Satan, who is elſwhere called, <hi>The prince of the world,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the ruler of the darkneſs of this world;</hi> that is, of <hi>unregenerate men,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 12. Epheſ. 5. 6. <hi>Ye were ſometimes dark, but now are ye light in the Lord;</hi> therefore ye were ſometimes <hi>unregenerate,</hi> but now ye are <hi>ſanctified.</hi> Ye were ſometimes dark. That which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominateth, uſeth to give the denomination: that is the reaſon, why the naturall man is called <hi>darkneſs</hi> in the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract,</hi> becauſe darkneſſe hath a predominancy in their minds. As, when a man is extreamly vitious, we call ſuch a man, <hi>Vice: Non eſt invidioſus, ſed invidia;</hi> He is not envious, but envy and malice it ſelf. <hi>Non eſt vitioſus, ſed vitium;</hi> He is not vitious, but vice it ſelf. The Papiſts call the Pope, of <hi>Holy</hi> His <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> becauſe they would have the world to believe him to be exceeding <hi>holy. Dark,</hi> in the <hi>abſtract,</hi> is exceeding <hi>darkneſs,</hi> in regard of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a threefold darkneſſe: the darkneſſe of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> oppoſed to the light of <hi>Knowledge;</hi> the darkneſſe of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> oppoſed to the light of <hi>Holineſs;</hi> the darkneſſe of <hi>Miſery,</hi> oppoſed to the light of <hi>Joy.</hi> This three-fold dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe accompanieth the ſtate of nature, even in all men, as long as they continue in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, that of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. A darkneſs of <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts.</hi> Some naturall men may have a deep reach in the things of the world, but there is a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon the face of the deep, a ſpirituall darkneſſe upon the deepeſt wits of naturall men; ſomething they know, but nothing as they ought to know, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Cor.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:168769:48"/> 8. 2. <hi>If any man thinketh he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</hi> They may perhaps know, that God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> but as long as they do not worſhip him in ſpirit, they know him not as they ought to know him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A darkneſſe of <hi>Sinfulneſs</hi> lyeth upon them: <note place="margin">2. A darkneſs of <hi>Sinfulneſſe.</hi>
                     </note> 1 Joh. 1. 6. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs,</hi> (that is, in ſin) <hi>we lie, and do not the truth. He that hateth his brother is in darkneſs,</hi> which is an expreſſion in that Epiſtle. How eaſily are men cheated in the dark, having bad wares put into their hands? They vent fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities inſtead of truths, they vent formalities inſtead of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they put off any thing to men in the dark. So, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſin comes to rule over them, becauſe they are in a ſtate of darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Darkneſſe of <hi>Miſery;</hi> ye ſhall find that called <note place="margin">3. A darkneſs of <hi>Miſery.</hi>
                     </note> darkneſſe, in Lament. 3. 1, 2. <hi>I am the man that have ſeen affliction, by the rod of his wrath; he hath put me into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but not into light.</hi> Darkneſſe there, is <hi>miſry.</hi> Such is the condition of all naturall men, though all be not alike ſenſible of it. <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> no doubt, was exceeding apprehenſive, after his <note place="margin">Foelicem fuiſſe meminiſſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerum eſt.</note> fall, of the change of his condition; but his poſterity are not ſo. It is in this caſe, as it fareth with a Nobleman, puniſhed with baniſhment into a forrain country, and there forced to live in a mean condition; he himſelf will be exceeding ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Simile.</note> of his alteration, from the Court, in which he lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the Cottage, in which he liveth now. But his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that were born in that condition, would not be ſenſible of the miſery they were in. <hi>Adam</hi> found what it was, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with God in Paradiſe, and what it was to be in a ſtate of life; therefore his fall went to his heart. But we, that are born in a ſtate of miſery, are not ſenſible of it, becauſe we know no better. Enough hath been ſaid, to cauſe every one to make haſte out of the ſtate of <hi>Nature,</hi> becauſe it is a ſtate of <hi>darkneſs.</hi> How formidable is darkneſſe? It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there fell upon him the horrour of a great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Gen. 15. 12. <hi>Lo, a horrour of great darkneſs fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</hi> Darkneſſe uſeth to be accompanied with horrour. And ſo it is with Nature; and yet this darkneſſe of nature is not formidable. How miſerable would men be, if they knew
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:168769:49"/> their condition? how much more miſerable, becauſe they do not know it? That in <hi>Egypt</hi> was palpable darkneſſe, which might be felt; here is that which aggravateth this darkneſſe, it keepeth it ſelf from being felt; men feel not their <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>ſinfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>miſery.</hi> Ye know the ſtory of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when he was in the dark dungeon, and his feet ſtuck faſt in the mire; <hi>Ebedmeleck</hi> letteth down cords to draw him up: <note place="margin">Jer. 38. 11, 12.</note> What a mad-man had he been, if he would not have faſtned the cords under his arm-holes, and ſuffered himſelf to be drawn up. Yet, ſo are the moſt in the world; the Miniſters of the Goſpell find them dark and filthy, in a darkneſſe of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and mire of luſt: Now God, by the Miniſtry of his Word, letteth down cords of love, to draw them up; ſo ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe are men, as to refuſe theſe offers, and there to lie and die, before they will come to Chriſt, that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This being ſuppoſed, I paſſe that, and go to the ſecond thing.</p>

                  <p>There is a light beſides this, that ſhineth from Chriſt in <note place="margin">2. Chriſt ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in his Word.</note> the <hi>Word;</hi> that is called his <hi>Teſtimonie,</hi> as the former is called his <hi>Witneſs,</hi> 1 Cor, 2. 1. <hi>I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, and wiſdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to you the Teſtimonie of God;</hi> that is, the Word of God, becauſe that teſtifieth what God is, and what he hath done, and what he requireth. It is true, there was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a written Word ſince the Fall, but a Word there was. God revealed his Will by Viſions, and Dreams, and other Intimations, in a way of Revelation to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Noah,</hi> and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the reſt of the <hi>Patriarks.</hi> It was a Word unwritten till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. And then, as at <note place="margin">The Word not written till <hi>Moſes</hi> his time</note> the Creation, Light was the firſt thing that was made, and yet ye read of no Sun till the third day. But all the light which was ſcattered throughout all the great frame of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> upon the third day, was gathered together, and united in the body of the Sun. So here, Truths were ſcattered before, now a little and then a little, by Dreams, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and Viſions; but in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, all the Truths that had formerly been revealed this way, God gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and united them in a written Word; then began the Scripture, and from that time forward it hath been enlarged. After <hi>Moſes,</hi> came the <hi>Prophets;</hi> after them, the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> So as this Age enjoyes the benefit of all the light, that former times have had. Thus you ſee it is made good, that a light from Chriſt hath continued to ſhine in all Ages, ever ſince the Fall. This letteth us ſee, that ignorant perſons, in all Ages, have been inexcuſable; they cannot ſay, but that God ſent them light, more or leſſe. Rom. 1. 20. <hi>The inviſible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall Power and Godhead; ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> No age can plead any thing for it ſelf, by way of excuſe, if it looketh not after God; and this age leaſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:168769:50"/> of all; for Chriſt, who hath continued to ſhine in all ages, ſhineth out moſt gloriouſly now. They had but, as it were, the <hi>Star-light</hi> before <hi>Moſes;</hi> afterwards (I will take in all that under <hi>Moſes</hi> too) it was but a <hi>Star-light</hi> in compariſon. In <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s time, they had, as it were, the light of the <hi>morning peeping out;</hi> he was the <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the <hi>Morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar,</hi> that came before the <hi>Day. Then came the Day-ſpring from on high to viſit us,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, he being both the Subject and <note place="margin">Chriſt both the Subject and the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpell.</note> the Preacher of the Goſpell. Then, the Sun aroſe, and ſo <hi>the light ſhined more and more to the perfect day.</hi> He ſent forth his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and endowed them with infallibility of ſpirit, <hi>And the holy men writ, as being moved by the Spirit of God.</hi> So as in the ages ſince, God hath been pleaſed to make good that, which was Prophecied of old, by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> firſt, and afterwards by <hi>Habbakuk, The time ſhall come, when the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, even as the waters cover the ſea,</hi> Iſa. 11. 9.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168769:51"/> the darkneſſe where it commeth: Let the Sun ariſe, Darkneſſe giveth way. But here, the <hi>Metaphoricall darkneſſe</hi> will not give way; that reſiſteth the light when it commeth, and prevaileth againſt it. Thus, in St. <hi>John's</hi> language, <hi>It com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth it not.</hi> Job 24. 13. <hi>Theſe are they that abhor the light, they know not the wayes thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</hi> They are of thoſe that rebell againſt the light. For the light that ſhineth in the works of God, darkneſſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth <note place="margin">Light ſhining in the Works of God.</note> it not. God hath gloriouſly appeared in the works of Creation, but with what iſſue? 1 Cor. 1. 21. <hi>Seeing the world by wiſdom knew not God, in the wiſdom of God, it pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a great deal of wiſdom appeared in the works of Creation, <hi>In wiſdom haſt thou made them all,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, of the works of God; and yet the world by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew not God. All that appeared of God by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, could not bring man to a <hi>taking knowledge</hi> of him. Therefore you ſee, God is put upon another way of ſaving man, (viz.) <hi>The fooliſhneſs of Preaching,</hi> as this place telleth you. Something men did apprehend of this light, but they comprehended it not fully: <hi>The light ſhineth in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, This light ſhineth in another light, a better and higher light, <hi>The light of the Word.</hi> How ſpeedeth that? <note place="margin">Light ſhining in the Word of God.</note> Why, darkneſſe comprehendeth not that neither. See what the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſaith of the Law, Hoſ. 8. 12. <hi>I have written to them the great things of thy Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing.</hi> If a <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhall deliver his will to his <hi>Servant,</hi> he expecteth obedience if he do but ſpeak the word; but if he ſhould give the ſervant his mind in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then he taketh it extreamly ill, if the errand be not done, the ſervant's neglect is inexcuſable. God hath not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his will, manifeſted his Law, but written his Laws; and they were counted as a ſtrange thing, people regard them no more, than if they were things that nothing concerned them, ſtrange things, which they had nothing to do withall.</p>
                  <p>It may be, the Goſpell had better entertainment, ſurely It deſerved better: Why, no; Darkneſſe comprehended not the light of the Goſpell neither: Rom. 10. 16. <hi>They have not</hi>

                     <hi>all obeyed the Goſpell, for Iſaiah ſaith, Lord, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>our report? Iſaiah</hi> complaineth, <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, both in the ſame words, <hi>Who hath believed our report, or to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> Not, but that ſome did entertain the Goſpell in all ages; but that doth not inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the truth of the Point, becauſe it was not by Nature that they did it, but by an over-powering work of Grace. The darkneſſe is ſaid, not to comprehend it, becauſe there were very few in all ages that entertained the Goſpell, in compariſon of them that refuſed it. It is ſaid by <hi>John, What he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his teſtimony.</hi> None? Yes, ſome received his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> in thoſe daies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it; yet it is ſaid, No man received it: that is, few, or none, in compariſon. Thus, in all ages, though the light did ſhine in darkneſſe, <hi>yet the darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> If ſo, let not Miniſters be diſcouraged to find it ſo at this day, <hi>It is bred in the bone, and it will never out of the fleſh.</hi> It is naturall with man ſo to do, not to comprehend the light, though it ſhine upon him never ſo clearly. If <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complaineth, and <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> what wonder is it, if Miniſters have the like occaſion to complain now adaies? Are they more <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Preachers than <hi>Iſaiah?</hi> and more wiſe than <hi>Paul?</hi> Nay, did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf complain, <hi>I have ſpent my ſtrength in vain?</hi> they are his words, Iſa. 49. 4. Yet, if any ſuch be here, let me ſpeak to them for encouragement, If thou art a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt, imitate Chriſt, continue to let thy light ſhine, though the darkneſſe comprehend it not; ſo did Chriſt. As a late faithfull Miniſter ſaid, If men repent not <note place="margin">Miniſters muſt preach, though the people do not repent.</note> upon my Preaching, however, it ſhall not repent me that I have preached to them: though my Doctrin be not a ſweet ſavour of life to them, I my ſelf ſhall be a ſweet ſavour to God, even in their damnation.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:168769:52"/>

                  <note place="margin">God teacheth men by men,</note> 
                  <hi>men.</hi> An Obſervation of ſome uſe, and worthy of our conſideration. It is the great Ordinance of God, that men ſhould teach men, that men ſhould bear witneſſe to Chriſt. And this God hath done, partly in reſpect to his own Glory, and partly in reſpect to our Neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Partly in reſpect to his own Glory, which ye have the Apoſtle clearly telling you, 2 Cor. 4. 7. <hi>God ſhineth in our hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſells, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.</hi> If God ſhould teach men by Angels Language, <note place="margin">not by Angels</note> Creatures more noble than themſelves, the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> would go near to ſhame them they are ſent to. But <hi>God hath put treaſures purpoſely into earthen veſſells, that the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the power might be of God, and not of us.</hi> Poor <hi>earthen veſſells,</hi> craſie men! a feavour commeth, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the earthen veſſell in pieces. Such is the beſt of men, <hi>earthen veſſells.</hi> Yet, how much treaſure doth God put into ſome of them, whom he intends to make inſtruments for his glory? Why? <hi>That the excellency of the power may be of God.</hi> It is God's carriage to make uſe of weak veſſells, that <note place="margin">1. In reſpect to his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> the praiſe may be for himſelf. As men that have a Jewell, they put it into a box of Cryſtall, that it may be ſeen through the Caſe, that the radiancy of the Jewell may appear through the tranſparency of the Glaſſe. So, God putteth his Word into earthen veſſells, that the excellency of the power may appear through the meanneſſe of them: He therefore purpoſely maketh choice of ſuch Inſtruments. If the Devill be to chuſe an inſtrument to work by, he will commonly chuſe one of the ſubtleſt, ſome cunning-pated man, ſome <hi>Machiavel,</hi> to be his inſtrument; if he chuſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other creature, it ſhall be a <hi>Serpent.</hi> But, when God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, when God hath a mind to confute <hi>Balaam,</hi> What creature doth he chuſe? An <hi>Aſſe,</hi> the ſillieſt of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe he would have his power to appear, in the ſimplicity and ſillineſſe of the inſtrument. That is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, He doth it in reſpect to his own Glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect to our Neceſſities. The truth is, we <note place="margin">2. In reſpect to our Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</note>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:168769:53"/> were not able to bear the Miniſtry of Angells, much leſſe to hear God himſelf ſpeaking to us from heaven. It was the uſuall preface of the <hi>Angels,</hi> when they appeared to men, <hi>Fear not, Fear not;</hi> becauſe their very appearing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies formidable to them that had Viſions. Ye know the ſtory of <hi>Manoah</hi>'s wife, and <hi>Zachary,</hi> and the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> her ſelf; they could not bear the preſence of God without horrour. Therefore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Speak thou to us and we will hear, but let not God ſpeak to us, leſt we die.</hi> Therefore he is gratiouſly pleaſed to make choice of men, to ſpeak to us by them, that are fleſh and blood like our ſelves. Let us learn, not to deſpiſe this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, to content our ſelves with it; not to talk of voices from heaven, when God hath ordained the voices of men, like our ſelves, to be the inſtruments of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. There is a voice indeed, but what voice? the voice of the <hi>Teacher,</hi> Iſa. 30. 20, 21. <hi>Yet ſhall not thy Teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers, and thine ears ſhall hear the word behind thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk in it:</hi> Namely, the <hi>Word</hi> from the mouth of the <hi>Teacher.</hi> It is true indeed, there is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. of ſending of ſome from the dead to teach the living; but the motion was made in hell, it was the motion of the <hi>Rich man</hi> in hell, to deſire of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he would beg of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſend ſome body from the dead. <hi>God hath put this treaſure in earthen veſſells, that the excellency of the power might be of him, and not of us.</hi>

                     <hi>thou me? Feed my ſheep. God is my record,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, how much I long after you all in the bowells of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And, <hi>My hearts deſire is, that Iſrael might be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To all this, there muſt go a <hi>Separation.</hi> Act. <note place="margin">3. <hi>Separation.</hi>
                     </note> 13. 2. <hi>As they miniſtred to the Lord, and faſted, the holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereto I have called them.</hi> Here is a <hi>Calling,</hi> but it is with a <hi>Separation,</hi> which is ſometimes made immediately by God himſelf, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> was called from heaven by God in Chriſt; and ſometimes mediately by the miniſtry of men, ſo <hi>Titus</hi> was called by <hi>Paul,</hi> and others by <hi>Titus, For this cauſe left I thee in Crete, to ordain Elderse in every City, as I had appointed thee</hi> Tit. 1. 5. Now, that the <hi>Man</hi> in the Text, <hi>John,</hi> was ſent of God, it appeareth in all theſe three reſpects: he had <hi>Ability,</hi> and <hi>Willingneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> to the work. His <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Willingneſſe,</hi> both appear in that expreſſion, which Chriſt himſelf giveth of him, Joh. 5. 35. <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light. Shining,</hi> in regard of his <hi>ability; burning,</hi> in regard of his <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> to do good to the ſouls of men. And for his <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he had an immediate Call by God himſelf, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, Luk. 3. 2. <hi>Annas and Caiphas being the high Prieſts, the word of God came to John the ſon of Zachariah in the wilderneſſe.</hi> As it was wont to do to the Prophets of old, who were extraordinarily called to that ſervice. Thus ye ſee, why a <hi>Man,</hi> and in what reſpect, <hi>he was ſent of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to inſiſt upon the Duties, that concern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from hence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seek God, in caſe you want Miniſters; for they <note place="margin">1. Seek God, in the want of Miniſters.</note> muſt be of his ſending. The Stars, they are in Chriſt's right hand, and therefore they ſet in one place, and riſe in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, even as he diſpoſeth and appointeth them. This leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Chriſt teacheth you, Matth. 9. ult. <hi>Pray the Lord of the harveſt, that he would ſend forth Labourers into his harveſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Bleſſe God in caſe you have them, for they <note place="margin">2. Bleſſe God, for having them.</note> are tokens ſent from Heaven. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thought himſelf exceedingly honoured, that the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould ſend
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168769:54"/> him <hi>Ambaſſadors:</hi> What an honour is it then for people, to have a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſent from God? It is an act of high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>The Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion upon his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Entertain them as men ſent from God. Trample not the gifts of God under your feet. The Galathians had <note place="margin">3. Entertain them, as men ſenr from God.</note> learned this, and accordingly <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of them, Gal. 4. 14. <hi>My temptation which was in my fleſh ye deſpiſed not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me as an Angel of God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Remember, they are Meſlengers, and let them have their errand; give them audience, and then give them diſpatch. The errand God ſends them about, is, to ſtirr men up to repent and believe. No more of that point.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was John.</head>
                  <p>He is here named, to add ſome honour to his teſtimony, becauſe he had this name impoſed upon him by the Angel, before he was born; which is an honour done to few in Scripture, Luk. 1. 13. <hi>The Angel ſaid to him, Fear not, Zachariah, thy prayer is heard, and thy wife ſhall bear a ſon, and thou ſhalt call his name John.</hi> It is the rather added, becauſe of the ſenſe of the name, which is from <hi>Jochen,</hi> which commeth of <hi>Chen,</hi> which ſignifieth Grace, The grace of God, which the name importeth. And it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came that perſon: both becauſe he was given to his parents as a favour from God, for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was barren, they were both old, and had no children; God giveth them <hi>John,</hi> as an act of grace and favour to them. And becauſe he was to be a Preacher of the grace of God in Chriſt; therefore he carrieth grace in his name, becauſe he came to point at the Lamb of God, that came to take away the ſins of the world. Becauſe he was endowed with grace from the womb, yea, and in the womb, therefore might well have the name of the grace of God given him then, before he was born. Or, becauſe he himſelf received a great deal of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God, even in that which he was ſent about, to be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:168769:55"/> the Fore-runner of Chriſt. <hi>The voice of one crying in the wilderneſſe.</hi> Here is the <hi>Voice,</hi> the Fore-runner of the <hi>Word. John</hi> was the Morning-ſtar, which was the fore-runner of the Day. As the break of day is the fore-runner of the riſing-Sun; ſo was he of the Sun of Righteouſneſſe. As it is in Trees, the bloſſom is the fore-runner of the fruit; and by the ſweetneſſeiof the bloſſom, the expectation of man is raiſed to look for deliciouſneſſe in the fruit. So were mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations raiſed, to look for ſomething in <hi>John</hi> more than in others, becauſe of his grace and favour with God. I I go on.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The ſame came to bear witneſs of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</head>
                  <p>Here ye have his Office deſcribed to you directly, from the proper Act of it, and the End of it.</p>
                  <p>The proper Act, <hi>He came to bear witneſſe of the Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two ſpeciall waies of bearing witneſſe to Chriſt, the one by <hi>Teaching,</hi> the other by <hi>Suffering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, By Teaching Chriſt. And thus all the Apoſtles were his Witneſſes, Act. 26. 16. <hi>Ariſe and ſtand upon thy feet, for I have appeared to thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a witneſſe;</hi> even a Witneſſe and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to teach Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is another Witneſs-bearing, that is, by Suffering for Chriſt, ſealing his witneſs with his blood; and thoſe are properly called Martyrs, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the Greek word, that ſignifieth <hi>Witneſſe.</hi> This name is given to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas</hi> under that notion, Rev. 2. 13. <hi>I know thy works, and where thou dwelleſt, even where Satan's feat is; and thou holdeſt faſt my name, even in thoſe daies wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>was</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>my faithfull martyr and witneſſe.</hi> Now <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> bore witneſſe to the truth, in both theſe waies, in Teaching Chriſt, and in Witneſſing too, in Suffering for him, he was beheaded; and ſo there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Martyrdome in his death. The Obſervation from hence is this, <hi>That men ſent from God, as John was, will bear witneſſe to the Light, as John did.</hi> God and Chriſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:168769:55"/> never left themſelves without witneſſe, <hi>God hath not left himſelf</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So, Chriſt hath not left himſelf without a witneſſe in his Word, ever ſince there was a written Word in all ages. The Fathers before the Flood, the Patriarks after the Flood, the Prophets after them, under the Law; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles under the Goſpell; they all bare witneſs to the <hi>Light. Noah,</hi> he received the doctrine of the Goſpell from the Fathers before the Flood, and tranſmitted it to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks after him; and him ye will find called by the name of a <hi>Preacher</hi> of righteouſneſs, 2 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>He ſpared not the old world, but ſaved Noah the eighth perſon, a Preacher of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The very righteouſneſſe of Faith, which we preach in theſe daies, <hi>Noah</hi> preached in thoſe, ſent forth by the Meſſiah to come, and righteouſneſſe to be by him. And after him, commeth <hi>Moſes</hi> the Law-giver. And whom does he bear witneſſe unto? Surely, to Chriſt, as it is clearly ſaid in <hi>John;</hi> He bore witneſs to me, ſaith Chriſt, Joh. 5. 46. <hi>There is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes, in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15. Deut. 18. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>whom ye truſt. For had you believed Moſes, you would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</hi> After him, came the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and witneſſed of Chriſt. After them, the Apoſtles, Act. 1. 8. <hi>Ye ſhall be witneſſes to me, both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermoſt parts of the earth.</hi> So they all witneſſed to the light, though not all with the ſame clearneſſe, As, a Light carried in the midſt of a company of men, they that go before the light ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but not ſo much as they that come after. The <hi>Fathers, Patriarks,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> they went before the <hi>Light,</hi> and ſo ſaw things leſs clearly; the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they came after it, and ſo are able to ſpeak more diſtinctly of his Paſſion and Reſurrection, and the things that concerned him. So as, to this day, it is the work of God, that <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould bear witneſs to the <hi>Light;</hi> therefore they are called Witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. that is the name given to them, that publiſh the truth of the Goſpel, againſt the incroachments of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> They are called two Witneſſes, two Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:168769:56"/> two Candleſticks. But <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> to import, that <note place="margin">Few witneſſes to the truth, in the daies of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
                     </note> thoſe that bear witneſſe to the light in the daies of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> are but few, if ye compare them with them that went the wrong way. And yet, <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> that is, a ſufficient number in all ages, to hold forth the truth, becauſe two witneſſes would ſerve to give teſtimony under the Law, <hi>In the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall the truth of every thing be eſtabliſhed.</hi> Though but two, yet two in the worſt times. And thus, <hi>Two Olive-trees,</hi> becauſe God, by them, conveyeth the oyle of grace into the hearts of his people. And <hi>two Candleſticks,</hi> becauſe they hold forth the light of the truth.</p>
                  <p>Now, this may ſerve as a touch-ſtone, to diſcern between <note place="margin">The true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpell.</note> true and falſe Churches, and true and falſe Miniſters. They that are ſent of God, they bear witneſs to the light, they ſet up Chriſt in their Miniſtry; they are content themſelves to ſtand in the croud, and to lift up Chriſt upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; content, not to be ſeen themſelves, ſo Chriſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. They lift him up, as the Serpent of old was lifted up upon the Pole, in the Wilderneſs. Men, in this reſpect, are like Trees, that receive their influence from Heaven, and raiſe up their tops towards heaven in a way of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whence they had their grouth. Men ſent from God, and having received all from Chriſt, return all to Chriſt in their diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>But now, look into falſe Churches, for inſtance, that of <note place="margin">The falſe ones of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Rome: Popery</hi> is, in effect, nothing elſe, but an <hi>under-hand cloſe witneſſe-bearing</hi> againſt Chriſt. Antichriſt oppoſeth Chriſt in all his Offices; under ſhew of witneſſing for him, he doth indeed witneſſe againſt him, both as <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>King,</hi> becauſe the Pope maketh himſelf the Head of the Church, which is proper onely to Chriſt. One that ſat <note place="margin">1: <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt as King.</note> in that Chair, was not afraid to call himſelf, <hi>Sponſum Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae,</hi> the Husband of the Church.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Prieſt.</hi> In that Office to which belongeth Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">2. As Prieſt.</note> and Interceſſion, ſee how they go againſt Chriſt, who offered himſelf once for all; their Prieſt muſt offer him up daily in the Maſs, and unbloody Sacrifice. So in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168769:56"/> they bear witneſs againſt him too, becauſe they joyne other witneſſes with him (as they acknowledge them) Saints.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Prophet.</hi> In that Office, they add Traditions to the <note place="margin">3. As Prophet.</note> Word; and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſaith, they are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>eâdem devotione,</hi> with the ſame devotion, that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be received with. This touch is but by the way, to fill your hearts more and more with deteſtation, againſt that way of Popery. If it be a dangerous thing for a man to bear falſe witneſſe againſt his Neighbour, What is it then to bear falſe witneſs againſt his God?</p>
                  <p>Now the End why he was ſent, is, <hi>That all men through</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The End why <hi>John</hi> was ſent.</note> 
                     <hi>him might believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no more in the Originall, but, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>That all might believe;</hi> but <hi>[men]</hi> is put in into the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How ſhould all men be ſaved by <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry, if it did not extend it ſelf to all men? His Miniſtry was confined to the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> he preached onely to the Jews. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Men</hi> not being in the Text, certainly the univerſall tearm is to admit of ſome reſtraint. I ſhall interpret it unto you, in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 26. which is ſomething parallel, where the debate was concerning the Baptiſm of <hi>John, Whether from heaven, or of men. If we ſhall ſay, From hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he will ſay to us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Why did ye not then believe him? But if we ſhall ſay, Of men, we fear the people; for all hold John as a Prophet.</hi> What, All the world? No, there were millions, and millions of millions, that never heard of <hi>John.</hi> But, <hi>All</hi> that were acquainted with his Miniſtry, <hi>they all</hi> held him as a Prophet. <hi>That all through him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> that is, All his hearers. <hi>All believe,</hi> and, <hi>through him:</hi> not, <hi>in him,</hi> as the <hi>Object</hi> of their faith; but, <hi>through him,</hi> as the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of their faith. <hi>That all.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That all his hearers, through him, might believe in Chriſt. <hi>Through him,</hi> but <hi>In</hi> the other. You have it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, Act. 19. 4. <hi>John verily baptized with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of repentance, ſaying to the people, That they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him which ſhould come after him; that is, on Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is <hi>through whom,</hi> and <hi>on whom; through</hi> John the Baptiſt, and <hi>on</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Office
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:168769:57"/> was, to make a way for Chriſt. As the cuſtom is amongſt great Princes, when they are to go to any place, they ſend before them their Harbingers to prepare the way, to tell the people who it is, that cometh to them, and what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at their hands, Gen. 45. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and went in the ſtreets, a man went before him, crying, <hi>bow the knee,</hi> And ſo <hi>Heſter</hi> 6. There was a man went before <hi>Mordecay;</hi> and proclaimed before him, <hi>What ſhall be done to the man, whom the King delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> So it was done to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>John,</hi> And ſo ſhall it be done to him, whom God delighteth to honour, To the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, whom God delighteth to ſeal. He came, thus prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt, that all hearers might believe through him in their Stations: which affords us this obſervation, <hi>That the end of good Miniſters witneſſe-bearing to the light, is, that all the hearers through them might believe in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That was the end of the Prophets-Miniſtry in the place afore cited, Acts 10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that, through his Name, whoſoever believeth in Him, ſhould receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> That was the end of the Apoſtles both Preaching, and Writing, Joh. 20. ult. <hi>Theſe things are Written that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that ye might have life through his Name,</hi> That is the end of our Miniſtry to this day.</p>
                  <p>Me-thinks, Our work is ſomething like that of <hi>Abraham's</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rebecca</hi> by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant wooed for <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
                     </note> ſervant, when he was ſent to get a Wife for his Maſter's ſon. He goeth on his errand, and telleth them of the family he came to, and where he found <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that his Maſter was a great potent Prince, that he had an onely ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom he made heir of all his Eſtate, and that he was ſent on purpoſe to perſwade <hi>Rebecca</hi> to come over, and be eſpouſed to this ſon. Such is our work: we are ſent to woo ſouls for <note place="margin">Souls by the Miniſters of Chriſt, wooed to Chriſt.</note> Chriſt. We tell you, What God is, and how glorious in himſelf, and all his attributes; and that he hath an only Son, the Son of his Love, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the heir of all things, The Father hath committed all judgment to the Son; And our errand is, to beſeech you, to go over,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168769:57"/> and leave your own father's houſe, and forſake all your luſts, and worldly Correſpondencies, and be married to this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. This is the end of our Miniſtry, to perſwade men to believe in Chriſt; becauſe we know, <hi>there is no other Name under Heaven, by which we can be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4. 12. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ſalvation in any other,</hi> No, there is no other Name given under Heaven, by which men muſt be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>We might tell you, as they do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Popery, a fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</note> of <hi>Pardons, Indulgences,</hi> and <hi>Pilgrimages;</hi> but this is, but to ſtill Children with rattles.

                        </gap>er,</hi> and <hi>Arpad,</hi> the Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> for there is no ſalvation to be had, but by Him. Therefore the end of our Miniſtry is, that all might believe in him; becauſe, As there is no other Name but his, by which we muſt be ſaved; So no other way to lay hold upon him, but by believing. <hi>The juſt they live by faith. The Righteouſneſſe of God is revealed from faith, to faith.</hi> Ye know how it was with the Woman in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that came to Chriſt in the crowd, and got healing from him. No queſtion, in ſuch a crowd, many touched Chriſt, (for He was in the midſt of the throng) as well as that Woman. But none received healing, but that woman, becauſe ſhe believed, that if ſhe could but touch him, ſhe ſhould be healed. So it is here, There is a crowd of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that ſeem to come to, and follow after, Chriſt; but none receive healing, but thoſe that believe indeed; and to them cometh a healing vertue. Well then, if this be the end of all Miniſters witneſſe-bearing; that through them their hearers might believe in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, learn from hence, to look at theſe Miniſters, as <note place="margin">Miniſters to be accompted publick bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> publick bleſſings: here is one, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, A man ſent from God, that all through him might believe. All that were within the compaſſe, and reach of his Miniſtry, if they were not wanting to themſelves, might be the better for him. <hi>That all through him might believe.</hi>

                  <p>It is no ſmall matter, this, whatſoever people may make of it, the Apoſtle happily ſetteth a high price upon it. <hi>All are yours,</hi> who? in the firſt place, <hi>whether Paul, or Apollos,</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:168769:58"/> 
                     <hi>or Cephas.</hi> He reckoneth up the Miniſter as a great part of their goods there. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. ſpeaking of the Aſcenſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſetting Him forth as a great Prince, he telleth you, what gifts He gave. Princes are wont in the dayes of their Coronation, to give largely to their Subjects, Chriſt was Aſcended, and Crowned with Glory, He led Captivity Captive, and was in his Triumph, <hi>He aſcended up on high, and gave gifts to men,</hi> what gifts? <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, and ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> theſe were gifts indeed. They were men of infallible ſpirits; But, <hi>he gave Paſtors, and Teachers, and Miniſters, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing this is the end of their witneſſe-bearing; learn to give heed to their Teſtimony, becauſe they are <note place="margin">Their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> ſent by God, on purpoſe, that you through them might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. They are Inſtruments, as of your faith, ſo of your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 14. The Philoſophers, make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſenſe of <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> The Apoſtles make it, the ſenſe of <hi>faith.</hi> Faith cometh by Hearing. Thoſe that cry out of too much preaching, are as if they were afraid of too much faith. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing, by the Word of God.</hi> It is the great ordinance that God hath appointed, to beget faith in the hearts of men. Unbelief came by hearing, by <hi>Eve's</hi> harkening to the Serpent. So God will have faith come by hearing, that we might beat the Devil at his owne weapon. <hi>Eve</hi> heard the ſerpent, and was drawn aſide from God. We by hearing of the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, are brought home to God. As <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith, ſweetly, That, <hi>we who were deceived by the ſubtilty of the ſerpent, might be ſaved by the fooliſhneſſe of God;</hi> (ſo the Scripture calleth the preaching of the Goſpel) 1 Cor. 1. 21. <hi>It pleaſed God, by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſave them that believe.</hi> This is not an arbitrary buſineſſe, that ye may take or leave, without danger, or loſſe to them that teach you rightly. It muſt coſt you dear. For out of the witneſſes mouths cometh fire, to devour their Enemies, Revel. 11. 5. <hi>If any man would hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths, and devoureth them.</hi> Theſe Sermons
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168769:58"/> which are ſo ſleighted at preſent, may be as fire in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences another day.</p>
                  <p>It was the manner under the Law, for the Witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Malefactor</hi> was ſtoned, to lay their hands upon his head; they were the firſt men that ſtoned him, Levit. 34. 34. <hi>Bring forth him that is to be ſtoned without the camp, and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and then let all the congregation ſtone him.</hi> This the Witneſſes did, to make it appear, that they tranſlated all the guilt from off themſelves, and laid it where it ought, upon the head of the <hi>Malefactor.</hi> So may Miniſters do, that come to be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the Light; they may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you the whole counſell of God, I am free from the blood of all men.</hi> They that have faithfully preached Chriſt in any place, may ſafely ſay, We have delivered our own ſouls, and done what in us lyeth to deliver yours, if you would believe. We come to bear witneſs to the truth, that all men, through us, might believe. So I have done with his Office, as it is directly laid down.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is laid down in oppoſition to a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, <note place="margin">The Jews falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceit <hi>John</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</note> that the Jews had of <hi>John,</hi> as if he had been the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias.</hi> To meet with this, <hi>He was not that light,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> here. This conceit of theirs ye ſhall find, Luk. 3. 15. <hi>As the people were in expectation, and all men muſed in their hearts of John, whether he were the Chriſt or no.</hi> Now to meet with this, and to clear it, ſaith the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt</hi> here, <hi>He was not that light.</hi> He was a light indeed, but not <hi>that light.</hi> He was, as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>a burning and a ſhining light;</hi> he ſaid ſo of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Joh. 5. 35. <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for a ſeaſon, to rejoyce in his light.</hi> There may be a Candle that is not lighted; a Candle may be lighted, and burn, and yet give but a ſmall light: But here, <hi>John</hi> was a <hi>burning light,</hi> and a <hi>ſhining light</hi> too. Therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonder, perhaps, why it is ſaid here, He was not <hi>that light.</hi> But the wonder will be over, if ye conſider, that <note place="margin">The vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>CHRIST</hi> and <hi>John.</hi>
                     </note> though theſe two are eminent lights; yet, to be <hi>that light</hi> was a farther buſineſs. <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>light enlightned,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>light enlightning: In him was light, and the</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:168769:59"/> 
                     <hi>light was the life of men. John</hi> had light by <hi>participation, Chriſt</hi> had light, and was light <hi>originally. John ſhined for a while,</hi> then his light was put under a candleſtick, when he was beheaded; but <hi>Chriſt ſhineth for ever,</hi> he hath ſhined in darkneſſe, and will ſhine to the end of the world. <hi>John</hi> was a light, <hi>Inſtrumentalitèr; Chriſt</hi> a light, <hi>Efficientèr: John, Inſtrumentally</hi> conveyed light into others by Chriſt; but Chriſt, the light <hi>Efficientèr.</hi> Who of himſelf, and by himſelf, by his owne power, conveyeth light by way of infuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of his ſervants. Therefore, to put the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it is purpoſely ſaid, <hi>He was not that light.</hi> We may note from hence, <hi>That God cannot endure to have that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>to any man, which is proper to Chriſt.</hi> Therefore I will here ſhew, Where the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ſetteth himſelf to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> yet he would not have him raiſed too high; he would not ſet him in the Throne: He doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely prevent all imaginations, of his deſerving what is Chriſt's due. <hi>He was not that Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look through <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in all ages: Ye ſhall find how ill God taketh it at the hands of men, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come to uſurp any thing out of the hands of Chriſt. As in old time, where there roſe up a <hi>Seducer,</hi> an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> that gave himſelf out to be <hi>that Star,</hi> which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> prophecied of, which was a prophecy of Chriſt; Now <note place="margin">Numb. 24. 17.</note> this fellow called himſelf, <hi>Ben-chomar, The ſon of a Star;</hi> this man profeſſed himſelfe to be Chriſt: but he was ſlain with thunder and lightning from heaven. And then the Jews called him, <hi>Ben coſmar,</hi> which ſignifieth, <hi>The ſon of a Lie.</hi> Ye have it ſaid, <hi>It is the voyce of God.</hi> It is proper onely to God. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man,</hi> as they ſaid true of Chriſt. But if <hi>Herod</hi> will take this to himſelf, when the people cry out, <hi>The voice of God, and not of man, Herod ſhall pay for it,</hi> it coſt him his life, Act. 12. <hi>He was eaten up with worms.</hi> If ye look into the beginning of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Herod</hi> had, before this, impriſoned <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſlain <hi>James</hi> with the ſword. God putteth up this, but if he will come to uſurp what is proper to Chriſt, God will put it up no longer, <hi>then the worms devour him. Herod</hi> might ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier take-away the liberty of one, and the life of another,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168769:59"/> than the glory due to the Son of God. This is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by them, that take too much upon them; and by them, that aſcribe too much to men. Some take too much upon them, even ſo much, as Chriſt himſelf can take no more. It is ſaid of the man of ſin, that <hi>he ſitteth in the temple of of God, as God;</hi> and ſome of the Popes ſat down ſo, as Pope <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth. When the people of <hi>Cicily</hi> had given ſome offence to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in an humble manner ſent their Ambaſſadors to make their peace, it is frequently known in Hiſtory, that thoſe Ambaſſadors deprecated in theſe very words, <hi>Thou Lamb of God, that takeſt away the</hi>

                     <hi>ſins of the world, have mercy upon us.</hi> Was not this a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, curſed, blaſphemous thing, for the man of ſin to have this ſpoken to him? <hi>All power,</hi> ſaith another <hi>Pope, is given to me in heaven and in earth.</hi> It is wonderfull patience, that <note place="margin">The Pope a Blaſpheme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On the other ſide, ſome there are that aſcribe too much to men, even that which is Chriſt's due, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him; as, when people, in trouble of conſcience, go to this or that godly Miniſter, or Friend, and do expect they ſhall have peace ſpoken to them from ſuch a mouth. Here is a great deal of diſhonour done to Chriſt. That man, whatſoever he be, <hi>is not that light;</hi> therefore they that go with this expectation, aſcribe too much to man. God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, ſendeth men away without comfort, becauſe they come in expectation of more than is in man: They come (as Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> was wont to ſay) not as to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> (who have nothing but what is derived) but as to <hi>Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as if men could conjure for comfort. Who is it that hath the <hi>keys of David, that ſhutteth, and no man openeth; and openeth and no man ſhutteth?</hi> This is Chriſt's prerogative. If he open the conſcience, all the devills in hell cannot ſhut it; and if he ſhut the conſcience, all the Angells in heaven cannot open it. As for Miniſters, they are Inſtruments through whom ye believe, yet they are but Inſtruments; therefore are ready to ſay to all men, upon ſuch occaſion, even as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid to them, when they had healed the lame man, Act. 3. 12, 13. <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, why mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>

                     <hi>ye at this, or why look ye ſo earneſtly on us, as though by our own power and holineſſe we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jeſus; it is He that hath done it.</hi> Look not on us, but look to Chriſt. We are not that Light. I conclude this, with that of the Apoſtle, purpoſely, 1 Cor. 3. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Who then is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas? but miniſters, by whom ye believe, even as the Lord giveth to every man.</hi> I have done with the declaration of <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s Office, ſave onely for what followeth in the end of the Verſe, which is nothing elſe but a repetition of what went before; namely, <hi>He was ſent to bear witneſſe of that Light.</hi>

               <p>What is his Employment? Certainly, ſo honourable a

Let us learn one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from hence, every one in his and her place, to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to Chriſt; Miniſters by preaching Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, who deſired <hi>to know nothing</hi> amongſt his people, <hi>but Chriſt, and him crucified;</hi> therefore he is called a <hi>Choſen veſſell, Paul</hi> is. But to what end? Act. 9. 15. <hi>The Lord ſaid to him, Go thy way, for he is a choſen veſſell to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and children of Iſrael.</hi> Here is the Miniſter's work, to bear Chriſt's name before the people, like thoſe Pitchers of <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 7. earthen pitchers indeed, and ſo <hi>earthen veſſells,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them; but they have a Lamp in them, and are choſen veſſells to bear the name of Chriſt, to witneſs to this truth. And ſo, <hi>Believers,</hi> in their conference, ſhould bear witneſs to Chriſt, by telling one another, what great things he hath done for their ſouls; diſcourſing of him, as the Diſciples in the way to <hi>Emmans,</hi> their talk was of Chriſt. As people, when they come from Market, they tell of their penny-worths. When people <note place="margin">How to bear witneſſe to Chriſt.</note> come from Sermons, they ſpeak what they have heard, and what a good bargain Chriſt is. <hi>All,</hi> of all ſorts, are called to witneſs for Chriſt, by their living; and if they be called to it by their dying, living to him, dying for him; there is witneſs born to Chriſt both theſe waies. All are not, indeed, called to Martyrdom, and ſo to teſtifie of Chriſt by their death; but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:168769:61"/> all are called to Teſtifie of Chriſt by their Life. As ye read of ſome that profeſſed God in their works, ſo ſome confeſſe Chriſt in their lives, thoſe that ſhew forth the grace of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>who are called out of darkneſſe, into his marvellous Light.</hi> Thoſe that can carry themſelves <hi>meekly</hi> towards the <hi>malitious,</hi> and <hi>humbly</hi> towards the <hi>proud,</hi> they may hereby, by their Carriage, bear witneſſe to that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and humility, which they receive from Chriſt, as the head and fountain of it. <hi>Whoſoever hath received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord truly, he will walk in him;</hi> not onely talk of him, but confeſſe him, not only with his mouth, but his life. Here is a way of witneſſing to him! That ye may be incouraged to witneſſe for Chriſt, take two Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If we do not witneſſe for Chriſt now, Chriſt will one day witneſſe againſt us, Mal. 3. 5. <hi>I will come neer to you in judgment, and I will be a ſwift witneſſe</hi> againſt ſuch and ſuch ſinners, as he there mentioneth. Chriſt himſelf will be a witneſſe againſt us, if we be not witneſſes for him, and a ſwift witneſſe too. And now beloved, Conſider with your ſelves, what aſtoniſhment ſeized upon the ſouls of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's</hi> brethren, as ſoon as he ſtept up to witneſſe againſt them, and ſaid, <hi>I am Joſeph, whom ye ſold into Egypt. And yet he did this</hi> meerly to inform them, and not to affright <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 3.</note> them. Who can tell the horrour, and amazement, which will fall upon the ſouls of men, when Chriſt will, at the laſt day, ſay, <hi>I am Jeſus,</hi> whom ye Crucified, and whom ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to believe, and whoſe Word, and Goſpell, ye have trampled under your feet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, That if we do witneſſe for Chriſt, we ſhall have <hi>Three,</hi> witneſſing for us; in whoſe Teſtimony we ſhall receive aboundance of Comfort.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſhall have a witneſſe without us, and a witneſſe within us, and a witneſſe above us. Without us; That is the Teſtimony of men, that fear God. If we witneſſe for Chriſt, They will witneſſe for us, even the Conſciences of wicked men will be inforced many times to witneſſe for us, when their words witneſſe againſt us. But though they ſhould not, yet <hi>by faith the Elders obtained a good report,</hi> Hebr. 11. 2.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:168769:61"/> The Saints will have a good report amongſt them that are Saints, like themſelves. <hi>Jonathan</hi> will witneſſe for <hi>David,</hi> though he incurre <hi>Saul's</hi> diſpleaſure for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhall have a witneſſe within us. That, is the Teſtimony of our Conſciences. Though there ſhould be ſtorms without, yet there will be a calme within. And it is the wind within that maketh the Earth-quake. And the wind within, that maketh the ſoul to quake. Conſcience is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God is greater then our hearts. He is a witneſſe for us: ſo ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Job 16. <hi>My witneſſe is in Heaven, and my Record is on high.</hi> Though men upon earth ſhould witneſſe againſt him, and though he ſhould not at all times have the peace of his Conſcience, ſpeaking good things for him, yet he hath a witneſſe above all, His witneſſe is in Heaven, and his Record on high. As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deus major Conſcientia; &amp; pro noſtra Conſcientia teſtatur.</hi> That is one end, why God will have men witneſſe for him, becauſe he might have occaſion to witneſſe for them, if time ſerve; what a comfort is here to have him witneſſe for us, who is our Judge, whoſe ſentence will never Certainly go againſt his Teſtimony. I have done with that, and proceed now to another argument, which the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> uſeth to prove, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> namely, from the effect of Illumination, generall Illumination.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The true light,</hi> becauſe <hi>undeceiving,</hi> in oppoſition <note place="margin">1. The unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Light, in oppoſition to falſe light.</note> to <hi>falſe,</hi> and <hi>deceitfull.</hi> In that ſenſe, ye find the word uſed by <hi>Joſeph's</hi> brethren, when they came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were taken for ſpies, Gen. 42. 11. <hi>Joſeph had ſaid, ye are ſpies; to ſee the nakedneſſe of the Land, ye are come. No, ſay they, we are all one Man's ſons, we are true men, thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are no ſpies. True,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>deceitfull.</hi> So Chriſt is called the true light, in oppoſition, to all the falſe lights of the Gentiles. They had their <hi>Idols,</hi> and <hi>Balaams.</hi> And ſo all naturall men to this day have their <hi>Lights,</hi> but they be falſe ones. The naturall man's light is, the <hi>Ignis fatuus.</hi> It is lightſome indeed, but he that followeth the light of it, is lead into ditches, and boggs, ſuch is falſe light which the Creatures afford, it leadeth to ſorrow. Man may hope for cheering, but he ſhall lye down in ſorrow for all that, Iſaiah 5. ult. <hi>Behold all ye, that kindle a fire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe your ſelves about with ſparks, walk in the light of your fire, but ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow,</hi> becauſe theſe are <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lights.</hi> But Chriſt is the true Light, becauſe, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever followeth him, is lead to everlaſting happineſſe, Joh. 8. 12. <hi>I am the Light of the World, he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>True light,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Reall light.</hi> True in <note place="margin">2. Reall, in oppoſition to Ceremoniall types, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</note> oppoſition to Ceremoniall types, and ſhadowes; As, <hi>true,</hi> that is, <hi>undeceiving,</hi> in oppoſition to the falſe light of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> So, <hi>true,</hi> that is, <hi>reall,</hi> in oppoſition to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Jews. So it is oppoſed to Ceremonies, 1 Joh. 17.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168769:62"/> 
                     <hi>The law came by Moſes, grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Where it is commonly thought, that Grace is oppoſed to the Morall Law, and Truth to the Ceremoniall. The Jews had their light; much light ſhined in Ceremonies and Types of old. But <hi>Chriſt was the true light,</hi> becauſe he was the Subſtance of all theſe, Col. 2. 17. <hi>which are all ſhadows of things to come, but the body is Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The true light,</hi> becauſe <hi>underived. True</hi> is <note place="margin">3. Underived, in oppoſition to borrowed, &amp;c.</note> ſometimes oppoſed to <hi>Borrowed, Communicated, Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated</hi> from another. Thus, Chriſt is called, <hi>The true God;</hi> and ſo God. The true God, in oppoſition, not onely to <hi>Idols,</hi> that have no <hi>Deity</hi> in them; but to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are called gods, by derivation of their Authority from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. 1 Joh 5. 20. <hi>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us underſtanding, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the <hi>true God;</hi> but <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> they are <hi>gods,</hi> but gods by <hi>derivation,</hi> and ſo not <hi>true</hi> gods. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>true light</hi> in this reſpect, becauſe he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth not his light. Some of authority, they ſay, are <hi>light, Ye are the light of the world,</hi> Joh. 5. Epheſ. 5. <hi>Ye were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but now are ye light.</hi> How? <hi>Light in the Lord.</hi> Chriſt hath light in him. You are a borrowed light, he is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived light; and ſo, <hi>The true light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>True,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſuper-eminently true,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <note place="margin">4. Super-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently true, in oppoſition to Common and Ordinary</note> to <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>common.</hi> So he ſaith, Joh. 6. 55. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed;</hi> it is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>truly drink;</hi> that is, not <hi>ordinary,</hi> not <hi>common,</hi> but <hi>ſuper-eminently meat and drink.</hi> Joh. 15. 1. <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> not an ordinary common Vine, but a ſuper-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent one, becauſe his Blood is more cheriſhing than Wine. And ſo, <hi>The true Light,</hi> a <hi>ſuper-eminent light,</hi> more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the <hi>naturall light</hi> in many reſpects. If the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light be cheering, why, Chriſt is ſo much more; light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth the eye, Chriſt refreſheth the ſoul more abundantly. Doth the naturall light penetrate, and ſearch into the moſt ſecret corners? Chriſt doth more ſearch into the heart and ſpirits of men, to diſcover what is hidden there. <hi>The hidden things of darkneſſe are made manifeſt by light.</hi> The hidden
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:168769:63"/> things of God are manifeſted by Chriſt, even the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel. Is the light of the Sun able to ſhine upon dunghills, and not receive defilement from them? Chriſt doth ſo much more: He ſearcheth into filthy hearts, and receiveth no defilement from them. Therefore <hi>the true Light,</hi> becauſe not <hi>ordinary.</hi> What ſhall we learn from hence? Why, to make out after Chriſt, and that upon this ground, becauſe he is <hi>the true light.</hi> Who is there, that is not deſirous of light? <hi>Truly</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 17.) <hi>the light is ſweet, and a pleaſant thing it is for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Sun.</hi> Chriſt is light, true light. Chriſt is ſweet, truly ſweet. A pleaſant thing it is for men to lay hold upon the Sun of righteouſneſs; no true pleaſure can be had any where elſe. If we find a dark room in a houſe, we ſay, This is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly room. It is the ſaddeſt condition in the world, for <note place="margin">The ſaddeſt miſery, to loſe our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. Exod. 10. 21, 22. Act. 27. 20.</note> men to want this light, nothing is worth the grieving for, in compariſon of this, being out of Chriſt, or having loſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt. A ſad condition it was for the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to be three daies in a palpable darkneſs; and for <hi>Paul</hi> and his fellowes, to be diverſe daies and nights, without the light of the Sun, and Moon, and Stars. What is it for men and women to continue for many years, without God and Chriſt in the World? Suppoſe a room were never ſo full of the moſt curious Pictures, if there be not windowes to let in light, the Pictures loſe their luſtre: So, let men have beauty, ſtrength, and never ſo good parts; all theſe, without the light of Chriſt in their ſouls, are neither beautifull nor lovely, nor of any worth at all.</p>
                  <p>Ye ſhould therefore learn to thank God for this great Gift, that he hath beſtowed his Son upon us, that we might not ſit in darkneſſe, but wait for him, as <hi>they that wait for the morning.</hi> Men that have moſt buſineſſe to do, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without light, How do they watch for the morning? Ho! the morning! ho! they cry out. <hi>Phoſphore, redde diem. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is that <hi>morning Star,</hi> and yet gave himſelf; therefore wait upon him for him. It is obſervable, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 16. he calleth himſelf the morning-Star, <hi>I Jeſus have ſent mine Angel to teſtifie theſe things to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. I am the root and off-ſpring of David, and the bright</hi>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:168769:63"/> 
                     <hi>morning-Star.</hi> And Rev. 2. 26, &amp; 28. He promiſeth to give the <note place="margin">Chriſt is the Morning-Star</note> morning-Star, <hi>He that over commeth, and keepeth my word to the end, I will give him the morning-Star.</hi> What is that? I will beſtow my ſelf upon him. Other Commanders, they give their ſouldiers ſome little pay; other maſters, they give their ſervants ſome little wages: But, he that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and keepeth my word, I will give him My ſelf, I will give him the morning-Star.</p>

                  <head>That was the true Light, that lighteth every man that commeth into the World.</head>
                  <p>Some difficulty is in this Clauſe: therefore, for the fuller explication of it, there are two Concluſions to be cleared, and two Queries to be reſolved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, two Concluſions to be cleared.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, <hi>That whatſoever any man receiveth, he</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Concluſ. </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>hath it from Chriſt. That was the true light, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Whatſoever man receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is from Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>every man.</hi> Indeed, in this ſenſe, many take it; as if one ſhould ſay, Such a Schoolmaſter, he teacheth every boy in the town. This were true, though every boy in the town did not go to ſchool. The meaning is this, That every one that is taught, is taught by ſuch a Maſter. And ſo, though every man, and every mothers ſon, ſhould not be enlightned; yet, it may truly be ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt enlightneth every man that commeth into the world,</hi> becauſe every man that is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hath his light from him. There is truth in that, but that is not all the truth. Thus far it is undeniable, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever light any man hath, he hath it from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is therefore called, <hi>The Sun of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Sun, that is the well-head of light; whatſoever light is in the Moon, or Stars, or inferiour Orbs, it is derived from the Sun. So, all light, whatſoever it is, it is derived from Chriſt. <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The ſecond Concluſion is this, <hi>That every man and</hi>

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:168769:65"/> or other, enlightned by Chriſt. But that is the importance of the expreſſion in the end of the Text, Every man that is born into the world; therefore [every man] cannot be reſtrained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe born into the world is too large an expreſſion. <hi>Every man that commeth into the wrrld.</hi> Ye may ſay, What mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>coming into the world?</hi> Joh. 18. 37. <hi>To this end I was born, and for this cauſe came I into the world. Born,</hi> and <hi>coming into the world,</hi> is all one. And ſo, dying, and going out of the world, is all one: <hi>Naked came I in, and naked ſhall I go out. We brought nothing into this world;</hi> namely, <note place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note> when we were born: <hi>and we ſhall carry nothing out,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when we die. So that man's coming into the world, is, Every man and woman that cometh by naturall generation into this world, is born into it.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to reſolve two Quaeries, of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whether the ſame meaſure of light be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Naturall light, that comprehendeth the light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the light of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Naturall Light. 1. Of the Sun.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, The light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> that makes all other things viſible, Pſal. 74. 26. <hi>Thou haſt prepared the light, and the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> a naturall light; <hi>In him</hi>

                     <hi>was light, and the light was the life of men,</hi> Joh. 1. 4. where the meaning is, That the light of Reaſon commeth from Chriſt to every man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The light of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is to be found even in every man by nature, by which he is prompted to <note place="margin">3.

And thus I underſtand that of Prov. 20. 27. <hi>The ſpirit of man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit,</hi> it is often put for <hi>conſcience; The things of a man knoweth no</hi>

                  <p>Supernaturall light, that comprehendeth three things. <note place="margin">Supernaturall Light.</note>

                  <p>The light of <hi>Glory,</hi> Col. 1. 12. <hi>He hath made us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>

The light of Grace, that is the fruit of the Word ingraffed; and the light of Glory, that is the crown and reward of Grace.</p>
                  <p>In all, there are ſix ſorts of Light, three <hi>Naturall,</hi> and three <hi>Supernaturall.</hi> The Firſt and Laſt of theſe, cannot be underſtood in the Text; the light of the <hi>Sun</hi> is the firſt, and the laſt is the light of <hi>Glory,</hi> which is not underſtood here. Though it may be affirmed, that the world continueth for Chriſt's ſake. That cannot be underſtood here, becauſe the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh of a <hi>Sun</hi> proper to man; whereas that is common to all the world, to brute beaſts as well as men; <hi>It enlightneth every man.</hi> The laſt of theſe, the light of <hi>Glory,</hi> cannot be underſtood here, becauſe no man partaketh of that, till he be gone out of the world; and, here, is light ſpoken of, given to them which come into the world. But the other four ſorts of light that remain, they are all taken in, the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the light of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the light of the <hi>Word,</hi> and the light of <hi>Grace.</hi> Theſe are the ſeverall Lights that come from Chriſt.</p>

                  <p> But I muſt ſhew you, That theſe are not divided amongſt mankind, nor communicated in a like meaſure to all; that ſo I may anſwer the firſt <hi>Quaery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, That all do partake of the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <label type="milestone">

What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Infants,</hi> and of <hi>Ideots;</hi> we muſt ſay, Even theſe have ſome light from Chriſt, but not like to other men. <hi>Infants</hi> have the gift of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> though not the uſe of <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> that gift they have from Chriſt. <hi>Ideots</hi> have the uſe of reaſon in ſome lower degrees, I, and of Conſcience too, in ſome lower acts, though neither Reaſon nor Conſcience, be ſo vigorous in them, as in other men.</p>
                  <p>To go on. The light of the <hi>Word,</hi> that is not equally diſpenced to all, as appeareth, Pſal. 147. two laſt verſes. <hi>He ſhewed his word to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes, and judgments</hi>

He that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to rain upon one City, and not upon another, ſendeth the word to one City, and Nation, and not unto another. He cauſeth the Word plentifully in ſome places to dwell, as in this <note n="*" place="margin">London.</note> City, at this day; but in other places, there is a famine of the word. So as the light of the word is not equally diſpenced now amongſt them, that do injoy the light of the word. The light of <hi>grace</hi> is diſpenced, but not in a way of equality.

Therefore, it is ſaid, Deut. 29. 3, 4. <hi>The great temptations which thine eyes have ſeen, the ſignes, and thoſe great miracles; yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear unto this day.</hi> Here were means, but no grace to improve them.

                  <p>Firſt, Chriſt doth diſpence <hi>Convincing light</hi> to every one, <note place="margin">1. All have light convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, ſufficient to leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</note> ſufficient to leave him without excuſe. So much the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith: Among the heathen which had no other light, but that of nature, no other knowledge of God, but that which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the works of <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> Rom. 1. 20. <hi>The Inviſible things of him, from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even the eternall power and Godhead;</hi> So that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe. If the very <hi>Gentiles</hi> had enough to leave them without excuſe; then much more ſuch, as live under the diſpenſation of the Goſpell; becauſe there goeth a Clearer light with the word, then doth accompany the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As the Sun-beams diſcover a great deal more, then the Moon ſhine, becauſe it is a ſtronger light; ſo the light of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and <hi>Word,</hi> being ſtronger then the light of nature, are more convincing then the other; ſo as every one, be he <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> be he <hi>Heathen</hi> without the Word, or a <hi>Profeſſor</hi> of Chriſtianity under the word, hath light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168769:67"/> to convince him, and to clear God in his proceedings againſt him. I ſay, not onely to convince him; but to clear the Juſtice of God: becauſe there is no man that walketh up to the utmoſt of his Life. No man may go to God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have done all I was able to do, and therefore, I challenge a reward at thy hands. This to be ſure; He hath enough to convince him, and to leave him without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt doth not diſpence to every one <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. All have not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting light ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring them to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>light,</hi> ſufficient to bring him to <hi>Salvation.</hi> There is no light ſufficient to bring to ſalvation, but that which Chriſt calleth the light of Life, John 8. 12. <hi>I am the Light of the World; he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi> Every man by nature, is not onely blind, but dead, dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; and therefore, muſt not onely have life, but ſuch a life, as may quicken him, <hi>The light of life.</hi> Indeed, if light alone will ſerve the turn, any kind of Illumination; then, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the will, and illumination of the underſtanding, and morall perſwaſion might prevaile, to bring a man to God. <hi>Hîc opus eſt medela, ſuadela non ſufficit.</hi> Here is need of quickning, therefore light will not ſerve the turn. It muſt be a <hi>quickning light,</hi> that ſufficeth to Converſion; This, Chriſt doth not diſpence to every one; for if He did, every one would come home to Chriſt. No man can have poſſeſſion of Chriſt, that is not over-powered to believe. <hi>Sufficient</hi> grace, and <hi>over-powering</hi> grace, is all one. Till a man be over-powered, he can never cloſe with Chriſt for ſalvation, Now becauſe, this over-powering grace is not beſtowed upon every one, therefore it is clear, that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace, <hi>the Life of light</hi> is not diſpenced to every one that cometh into the World. Without Chriſt no ſalvation, without faith, no cloſing with Chriſt. <hi>All have faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. That is, all might have faith if they would, ſay ſome, Therefore God doth to every one give ſufficient light, remotely ſufficient; becauſe, ſay they, He giveth them ſuch light, as, if they would follow it, He would give them faith. This is commonly ſaid. But I could never yet ſee it proved. Whereſoever there is an improvement of natural life, men ſay, there ſhall certainly be an addition of ſuper
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168769:67"/> naturall diſcoveries of Chriſt, and ſo power to believe. If there be no ſuch thing, the connexion between the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what a man hath, and the donation of what he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in need of, for to bring him to ſalvation, muſt depend either upon the merit of man, that doth ſo improve his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or upon the promiſe of Chriſt, that whoſoever doth improve his naturall abilities, ſhall have grace vouchſafed to him. But it dependeth upon neither of theſe. Therefore no ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it doth not depend upon the merits of man, nor upon his utmoſt improvement of naturall abilities; ſo long <note place="margin">Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, nor their improvement of naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</note> as we are out of Chriſt, all our abilities are but naturall, they cannot deſerve the grace of Chriſt. No creature can raiſe it ſelf to an higher kind, by improving of what belongeth to it in a lower ſphear. As for example. Take creatures that onely have ſenſe in them, it is poſſible, by art and induſtry, to bring them to a great exactneſſe, in the exerciſe of their ſcience; as, an Horſe to dance, an Elephant to write, and a Parrat to ſpeak; but none can bring them to Reaſon, becauſe that is a thing of an higher ſphear. So, take a Man, that is naturall; by the improvement of nature, he may go on a great way: but he cannot, by all the improvements of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſerve grace at the hands of God. The Papiſts call this the Merit of Congruity; if a man improve what he hath, he deſerveth, <hi>ex Congruo,</hi> that God ſhould give him more. But, if ſo, then the heavenly Call, upon which Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, to ſuch a man it will be of works, and not of meer mercy; contrary to that of the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 1. 9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world was.</hi> Thence followeth Calling from Election, not from improvement of our abilities in our own works. Might ſuch a man ſay, I am called; and why? why, according to my works and improvements. How then ſhall that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Rom. 9. 15, 16. be overthrown? <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> According to this way, in the merits of Congruity, it will be of him that willeth, and runneth, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168769:68"/> not of meer mercy. Then it cannot follow from the merits of man. But perhaps it followeth from the promiſe of God, <note place="margin">Nor upon the Promiſe of Chriſt.</note> That is the <hi>Armintan</hi> way. Let ſuch a promiſe be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and how gladly will men ſubmit to it? That which the <hi>Arminians</hi> pitch upon, is this, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given;</hi> a ſpeech of Chriſt, which is annexed to two ſeverall Parables, to the Parable of the <hi>Sower,</hi> and to the Parable of the <hi>Tares: To him which hath ſhall be given.</hi> Therefore, ſay they, if a man improve his Naturalls, he ſhall have Grace; if his Reaſon, he ſhall have Chriſt. But there is a great miſtake in this; for the utmoſt that this Promiſe will bear, is, a reward for them in the ſame kind, for an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what one hath, and uſeth aright. He that uſeth his naturall wit aright, ſhall have more naturall wit; he that uſeth his parts, ſhall have more parts; and he that uſeth his graces, ſhall increaſe his graces. And in this ſenſe, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall more be given.</hi> A man may as well ſay, He that uſeth his wealth well, to him health ſhall be given; and he that uſeth health well, to him wealth ſhall be given; as to ſay, He that uſeth his reaſon well, to him grace ſhall be given; for here is a tranſition, or paſſing into another kind of thing; whereas the promiſe runneth, for the increaſe of a thing of the ſame kind. This may ſuffice to clear that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Quary,</hi> namely, Whether ſufficient light be given to every one. In theſe two Propoſitions, Chriſt doth diſpenſe to every one light ſufficient, to leave him without excuſe. Chriſt doth not diſpenſe to every one Converting-light, ſufficient to bring him to Salvation. I have done with the Explication of the Point.</p>
                  <p>For the Uſe of it, briefly. If Chriſt doth thus lighten every man that commeth into the world, let us learn from hence theſe four Leſſons.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> all the light, which we our ſelves and others have, even as <note place="margin">Learn to See Chriſt.</note> ye ſee the cauſe in the effect; in Chriſt, as the Author of all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168769:68"/> that light. When ye ſee men, knowing men, men of great underſtanding, there is much of the light of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> ſtrict men, there is much of the light of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> holy men, there is much of the light of <hi>Grace.</hi> Admire Chriſt in all theſe, for all commeth from him. Think, how holy, and how underſtanding Chriſt is, in whom all the treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge are. We are many times apt to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire men, and to over-look Chriſt; this ſhould not be. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man, that were kept in a deep dungeon all his daies, and were brought out at midnight, when the Moon ſhineth; this man would be apt, when he looketh upon the Moon, to think it to be the moſt glorious creature that he ſeeth, to be the ſpring of all light; for it is the moſt glorious creature that ever he ſaw. But, let him but ſtay till morning, when the Sun ariſeth, and he will be aſhamed of his miſtake. If we ſee men that ſhine as the Moon, think how much more glory there is in Chriſt. This is the way to ſee him, in all the light diſpenced by him to the creatures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We ſhould learn hence <hi>to ſeek Him,</hi> for the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> encreaſe of light; for, <hi>He is the Father of lights,</hi> ſo ſaith <note place="margin">Learn to Seek him.</note> 
                     <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1. 17. <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above, and commeth down from the Father of lights.</hi> Some men are of a fooliſh conceit, that men derive their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings from ſuch Conſtellations at their birth, and that maketh them wiſe. No, it is not the <hi>light of heaven,</hi> but it is the <hi>Father of lights.</hi> It is Chriſt that conveyeth all underſtanding to men: He is not onely the <hi>Author</hi> of all the light we have, but the <hi>Father</hi> of it. He is the <hi>Author</hi> of many things, that bear his Image; He is called the <hi>Father</hi> of lights, becauſe all the light we have, hath a clear impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the night, of and upon it, even, that of Reaſon, which is like <hi>Mephiboſheth;</hi> it is lame, but yet it is of the Blood-Royall. There is much in the light of Reaſon, much more in the light of the Word, and of Conſcience, and of Grace. Do we want light, as who doth not? Seek to him that is the Father of light; he is the Father of Supernaturall light as well as of Naturall. Seek him, but in a way of humility and ſincerity; otherwiſe, little hope of finding him. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpeech of <hi>Bernard:</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Superbo oculo non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:168769:69"/> 
                     <hi>veritas, ſincero patet;</hi> Truth is not ſeen by a proud eye, it openeth it ſelf to a ſincere one. Humility ſitteth loweſt in the School. Take out thy Leſſon in the School of Chriſt, ſeek it ſincerely. Painted Glaſſes hinder the light from comming into the room. He that will too much paint, that is, play the hypocrite, hinders the light from entring his ſoul. It is the ſincere heart that receiveth the light of the truth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let us hence learn <hi>to ſerve him;</hi> for all light tendeth to ſome work. <hi>The Sun ariſeth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Learn to Serve him.</note> Pſal. 104. 22, 23. <hi>and man goeth forth to his work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour till the evening:</hi> God ſheweth man light to work by, and that is the end of the light; that, Chriſt ſcattereth abroad in the world, not to loyter by, but to do ſervice with. <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord, ſearching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts of the bowells.</hi> Chriſt hath ſet up a candle in every one of our hearts, not to play by, as children uſe to do, to play by the candle that they ſhould go to bed by, and go to bed in the dark, when they have done. Many men miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their time which God hath given them, and ſo lie down in darkneſſe. Some men, God giveth wit to, and they employ it to the diſhonour of Chriſt, and the reproach of the Goſpell: for the true end of the light is, that we may do ſervice. If ye give light to your ſervants to work by, ye expect, they ſhould do more and better work, than they that go to work in the dark.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bleſſe him,</hi> for he it is from whom we have all our light, thoſe four lights, I told you of. <hi>The light of</hi>

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> is that, that diſtinguiſheth us from beaſts; it is that, <note place="margin">Learn to Bleſs him.</note> which, though it cannot find out the deep things of God, yet, when they are revealed, it may help to confirm them. As, when men go to plant a Vine, firſt, they take out the earth, and make way for the root; but when they have planted the Vine, they put in the earth again, and that better confirmeth the grouth of the Vine. There are ſome kind of myſteries of faith, that a man muſt take away his reaſon before he goeth to believe them, he muſt not firſt diſpute, and then believe; but when faith is once planted, lay to it reaſon, and it helpeth to confirm the excellency
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168769:69"/> of faith it ſelf. If ſo much in the light of Reaſon, how much more in <hi>the light of Conſcience,</hi> which God hath ſet as a <hi>Schoolmaſter</hi> in every man's boſom, to teach him, what is good, and what is evill. It is ſaid to be a bridle to keep from evill, to reſtrain a man, that is to commit evill, from the evill. And for <hi>the light of the Word,</hi> it is the crown of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Church is repreſented to us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the twelve Apoſtles is the Crown of the Church. And <hi>the light of Grace, Peter</hi> telleth you what that is, 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>It is a marvellous light.</hi> Therefore may every true Convert ſay, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſſe his holy name.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, a generall preſence of Chriſt, by which he is with <note place="margin">1. A generall preſence of Chriſt in the world.</note> all the Creatures, preſerving them, and upholding them; according to what is ſaid, Hebr. 1. 3. <hi>Who being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his glory, and expreſſe Image of his perſon, hath upheld all things by the word of his power.</hi> Which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpoken to, Col. 1. 17. <hi>He was before all things, and by Him all things conſiſt.</hi> He was in the World, which He himſelf made, as a Carpenter is in a houſe, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath built. A Carpenter buildeth an houſe to dwell in, and then keepeth it in repaire. Chriſt ſo made the World, not as to leave it, but ſo as to keep in it, and preſerve it, as well as to make it. As ſuppoſe a man, that were both a Ship-wright, and a Ship-maſter: He firſt maketh the ſhip, then goeth to Sea in it himſelfe. Chriſt hath ſo made the World, as to preſerve the World, which he made; as to look after it, and every thing in it. <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by Him.</hi> Theſe words are added, to ſhew that he was not in the World, as <hi>part</hi> of the World, but as the <hi>Maker</hi> of it. He was not in the World, as a <hi>Creature,</hi> but as the <hi>Creator</hi> of all things. According
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168769:70"/> to what the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> hath taught us before, <hi>By Him were all things made, and without Him was nothing made, that was made.</hi> He was in the World, and the World was made by Him; and the World knew him not. Ye have here the <hi>World</hi> in another ſenſe. The world in the beginning of the verſe, is taken for the whole Fabrick of Heaven, and Earth, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>The World is a Maſſe, made up of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth.</hi> In this ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>He was in the World, the World was made by Him.</hi> Now in the latter Clauſe of the verſe, <hi>The world knew Him not,</hi> The <hi>World</hi> there, is put for the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the earth, for the men of the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. The World, and Men, are all one. <hi>By one man's diſobedience, ſin entred into the World, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed over all-Men.</hi> Here is the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>all men.</hi> The world was made by Him, and the world, that is, the men of the world, knew him not. It is a Rule in Divinity, <hi>Verba Cognitionis, affectiones im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, &amp;c.</hi> Words of knowledge, import affections, and operate ſuitably. So, to know, carrieth more then meer ſpeculation. When Chriſt is ſaid to know us; The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> telleth us, It is more then barely to take notice of us: It is to take care for us, Joh. 10. 14. <hi>Chriſt knoweth his ſheep,</hi> that is, he taketh care of his <hi>Elect. And he is known of his,</hi> that is, He is ſerved, and obeyed, and worſhipped, and believed on by them. <hi>So the world knew him not,</hi> that is, the World worſhipped him not, as <hi>God;</hi> The world did not owne Him, and ſerve Him, as became their Creator. So as now, the words thus opened, The obſervation lieth clear before us, namely. <hi>That, notwithſtanding Chriſt's</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>being in the world, and the world being made by Him, the men of the world knew him not.</hi> Take a place, or two, to clear up this, eſpecially in reference to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for to them properly it belongeth. I ſhould have told you, that the word, <hi>World,</hi> is ſometimes confined to them. If the fall of them be the diminiſhing of the world, and the fall of them the riches of the Gentiles. <hi>He came to his owne, and his owne received him not.</hi> That is, did not know him, 1 Joh. 2. 1. <hi>Therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew not him.</hi> There is yet a clearer place, 1 Cor. 1. 21.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:168769:71"/> 
                  <hi>After that, in the wiſdome of God, the world by wiſdome knew not God.</hi> All the wiſdome the <hi>Heathens</hi> had, could not raiſe them to a due knowledge of God; The world by wiſdome knew not God. <hi>Chriſt was in the world, but the world knew him not.</hi> A threefold ignorance of Chriſt was found in all the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, They knew him not, as the ſecond perſon in the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They knew him not, as <hi>Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, They knew him not, as <hi>Creator,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly here ſpoken to. <hi>He made the world, and the world knew him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me run over theſe briefly: firſt, They knew him not <note place="margin">1. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles knew not Chtiſt as the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity.</note> as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity; ſo they are ſaid to have been without Chriſt, and without God in the world, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. ſpeaking there of the Gentiles, ſaith he; <hi>At that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having no hope, and without God in the World.</hi> They had the great book of the Creatures to read, but that did ſhew them nothing of Chriſt, as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity. Naturall reaſon could never find out that Myſtery in it ſelfe. Therefore men, when they go to find out this great myſtery of the Trinity, they are at their wit's end; They might find out a God, and that he was Good, and Great, and that he was One: but to find out a Trinity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, a <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> This they could not. Take a curious piece, a well drawn Picture, he that ſeeth it may be able to ſay, that he that drew it, was a skilfull, and exact <hi>Painter.</hi> But whether an <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> or a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or a <hi>Dutch man,</hi> or an <hi>Italian,</hi> that he cannot tell by the Picture, why? becauſe he made this piece, as an <hi>Artiſt,</hi> but not as a <hi>German,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh man.</hi> Therefore he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth his <hi>Art</hi> by the piece, but not his <hi>Country.</hi> So God made the World, not as Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Three</hi> in <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in <hi>three;</hi> All the works towards the Creatures, works <hi>ad Extra,</hi> are common to all the perſons in the Trinity. God, as God, made the world. Therefore by the ſight of the world, men may be able to know, that it
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:168769:71"/> is a God that made it, and that this God is good, becauſe he made ſo many things uſeful in the world; &amp; this God is wiſe, becauſe of the variety of the creatures; and this God is One, becauſe of the order of things: But to ſay, This God is <hi>Three</hi> in <hi>One,</hi> the Creation of the world doth not bear this. If the works be <hi>ad Intra,</hi> as <hi>Generation,</hi> theſe are the works of ſome one Perſon; but the works <hi>ad extra,</hi> they repreſent the <hi>Godhead,</hi> but not the <hi>Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They did not know Chriſt as <hi>Mediator,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">2. They knew not Chriſt as Mediator.</note> they raiſed up many Mediators: 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. <hi>Though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there be gods many, and lords many: But to us, there is but one God; the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth here clearly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the cuſtom of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who had two ſorts of gods, they had their <hi>dii Coeleſtes,</hi> their ſupream heavenly gods, which they worſhipt, as the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars:</hi> and then, beſides theſe, they had their <hi>dii Terreſtres,</hi> infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour gods, gods on earth, who were men that lived upon the earth, which were afterwards canonized, and made <hi>gods.</hi> That is the true meaning of this, <hi>There be many that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth.</hi> So, <hi>there be gods many, and lords many; gods many,</hi> thoſe are their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream gods; <hi>lords many,</hi> thoſe are their inferiour gods, <hi>Baalim,</hi> as they called him, who was the firſt King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and the firſt that was made a god; and all thoſe kinds of gods therefore after him, were called <hi>Baalim;</hi> as <hi>Caeſar,</hi> being the firſt Emperour, all <hi>Emperours</hi> after him were called <hi>Caeſars.</hi> Now, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, To us is but one God,</hi> not many; <hi>but one Lord,</hi> not many; but one Mediator, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They knew him not as <hi>Creator;</hi> therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. They knew not Chriſt as Creator.</note> when he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> found them ignorant of this. <hi>Greece</hi> was the Eye of the world, and <hi>Athens</hi> was the Eye of <hi>Greece;</hi> yet, even at <hi>Athens, Paul</hi> found an Altar, <hi>To an unknown God;</hi> and that ſame God was the God that made the world, God the <hi>Creator,</hi> Act. 17. 23, 24. ſaith <hi>Paul, For as I paſſed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:168769:72"/> 
                  <hi>Altar, with this inſcription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD; Whom therefore ye ignorantly worſhip, him declare I unto you. God that made the world, and all things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord both of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands.</hi> No wonder if the Heathen did not know Chriſt as the <hi>Creator;</hi> for the Jews, after Chriſt was come in the fleſh, and began to put forth a creating power in their ſight, yet would not own him as Creator of the world. To make him ſee that was born blind, and to raiſe him that was dead, requireth no leſſe ſtrength, than the ſame power that made the world. This Chriſt putt forth to the Jews. <hi>Lazarus</hi> cometh out of the grave, even as the world came out of the <hi>Chaos</hi> at firſt, at the commandment of Chriſt. He then ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> He now ſaith, Let there be life, and there is life: And <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> yet he was not owned as the Creator. The world knew not him as the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> neither as <hi>Mediator,</hi> nor as <hi>Creator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now proceed to the Application of this.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of Admonition. It teacheth us all to take <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> heed of being ignorant of Chriſt. You ſee, it is laid to the <note place="margin">To teach us to take heed of being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Chriſt.</note> charge of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> here, that they knew him not; and how much more heavy will the charge be againſt us, that enjoy other kind of means than the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had: They, indeed, had he works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence;</hi> We have them too, and a greater light than ſo: we have the Word <hi>to be a light to our feet, and a lamp to our paths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had the Oracles of the <hi>Sybbils,</hi> we have the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Therefore, ſuch as refuſe to uſe the means of knowing Chriſt as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> they muſt certainly expect to know him as an <hi>Avenger:</hi> For, <hi>He will come ere long,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, to render vengeance,</hi> to whom? <hi>to them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Indeed, God will not reckon with men for their Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ignorance, that is, for their bare not knowing, what they are not bound to know; but for their Privative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for not knowing what they ought to know, and what
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:168769:72"/> God giveth means to them to know; for that, he wil be ſure to reckon with them: And thoſe that continue wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in ſuch things, muſt be miſerable againſt their wills. Wherefore, to the end ye may all thirſt after the knowledge of Chriſt more and more, I ſhall propound to you two things.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Conſider the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the knowledge of <note place="margin">The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the knowledge of Chriſt.</note> Chriſt, of which ye read, Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I eount all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus, my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and account them dung, that I may win Chriſt.</hi> All is but droſs and dung to <hi>Paul,</hi> in compariſon of the knowledge of Chriſt. How is it, that amongſt us, men run after droſs and dung, and neglect the knowledge of Chriſt, as preferring that before him? <hi>For the excellency of the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi> Nothing in the world ſo excellent as knowledge, no knowledge ſo excellent as that of Chriſt. Other knowledge may, perhaps, make a man famous, this onely can make him holy and happy; other knowledge can give him the eſteem of a learned man, this onely can make him to be a Saint. Therefore an excellent knowledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a neceſſity of this knowledge, whether <note place="margin">The Neceſſity of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt.</note> you look to</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, If ye look to <hi>Juſtification: By his knowledge ſhall</hi>

Amongſt men, ſome are better known
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168769:73"/> than truſted; it is not ſo with God, for according to our knowledge of him, ſo there will be a proportionable truſting in him: Pſal. 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> No knowledge, no faith; and according to the meaſure of our knowledg, ſo will the meaſure of our faith be. Thus, you ſee a neceſſity of knowledg, in point of <hi>Juſtification</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, In point of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 3, 4. <hi>Hereby we</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. As to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> 
                  <hi>know him, if we keep his commandments. He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> Where there is a fatherly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there will be obedience; for this knowledge of an Object ſo amiable, will ingender love, and that love will be the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is neceſſary in point of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt long upon theſe things, Hence it is, that all theſe three <note place="margin">3. As to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> things, namely, the <hi>ſtate of ſalvation,</hi> the <hi>miniſtry of the Goſpell,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> come under one and the ſame notion in Scripture, under the notion and name of <hi>Eternall life.</hi> The everlaſting ſtare of Happineſs, that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Eternal life,</hi> Matth. 25. ult. <hi>They ſhall go away into everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternall.</hi> The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpell,</hi> that is called <hi>Eternall life;</hi> Act. 13. 46. <hi>It was neceſſary</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Barnabas</hi> there) <hi>that the word ſhould firſt be ſpoken to you; but ſeeing you put it from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> They that reject the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, are ſaid to account themſelves unworthy of everlaſting life. Thirdly, the <hi>knowledge of Chriſt</hi> is called ſo, Joh. 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternall, to know thee the onely true God, and Chriſt Jeſus whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> What is the reaſon of this? Becauſe theſe make way for the other; the Miniſtry of the Goſpell, that maketh way for the knowledge of Chriſt; the knowledge of Chriſt maketh way for the ſtate of Bliſſe and Glory. Therefore all cometh under the notion of <hi>Eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come to a ſecond thing. Notwithſtanding <hi>Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This lets us ſee, by way of <hi>Information,</hi> the <hi>unthankfulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>happineſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:168769:73"/>
               <p> Firſt, See the <hi>unthankfulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi> If one <note place="margin">1. Of the world's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe.</note> ſhould build an houſe for a man, then furniſh it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put the poor man, that was harbourleſſe before, into it, and put a ſtock into his hands to trade withall, and keep his houſe in repair for him, and require no other Rent, but ſome ſmall acknowledgment: Would not all the world cry ſhame of this man, if he ſhould not be thankfull? It is our caſe: God hath made a world for man, and furniſhed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought man into it; Jeſus Chriſt, he hath been in the world ever ſince the Creation, upholding all things by the word of his power. And yet ſuch is the unthankfulneſſe of men, that they know not Chriſt: <hi>He was in the world, the world was made by him, and the world knew him not,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not acknowledge him as their <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> Such is the madneſſe of men, that they are over-apt to beſtow divine honour upon <hi>thoſe</hi> it belongeth not to, and to deny it to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whom it appertaineth. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had cured the Creeple, Act. 14. 11. they had much ado to ſtave off the people from making gods of them; <hi>Now when the people ſaw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, ſaying in the ſpeech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeneſſe of men. And they called Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, Jupiter; and Paul Mercurius.</hi> The Prieſts of <hi>Jupiter</hi> offered ſacrifice to them. Chriſt doth a great deal more than this commeth to, and yet men own him not. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord,</hi> (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid) <hi>O fooliſh people and unwiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It helpeth to clear God, and to magnifie the <note place="margin">2. Of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He made the world, the world knowes him not; and yet he letteth the world ſtand for all this. He hath let the world continue almoſt ſix thouſand years, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this ingratitude of the world. We may well, upon this occaſion, call to mind that which the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> recordeth, Hoſ. 11. 8, 9. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael? how ſhall I make thee as Admah? how ſhall I ſet thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, the holy</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:168769:74"/> 
                  <hi>One in the midſt of thee, and I will not enter into the City. For I am God, and not man.</hi> Here is a great evidence, that Chriſt is God, and not man; otherwiſe, the world had been made as <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> long ere this. Suppoſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> himſelf, (the meekeſt man upon earth) to be indowed with that power, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had in his hands from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world; and ſuppoſe him to have hated ſin, as Chriſt doth: It would have been impoſſible, even for <hi>Moſes,</hi> to have held his hands. He that cryed out at the Rock, <hi>Ye rebells, ſhall I bring water out of this Rock to you?</hi> would certainly have cryed out, Ye rebells, I will ſend down fire <note place="margin">Exod. 17. 2.</note> upon you from heaven, to conſume you. What an high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is this, when Chriſt hath done ſo much, to have all ſleighted? Men take it ill, when there is any competency of worth in them, to be neglected. Not to ſpeak of the worth of Chriſt as <hi>Redeemer,</hi> look to his works of <hi>Creation;</hi> ſee what glorious Attributes ſhine in them; do but compare them with the works of men: If a workman doth many things, ſurely they are not great; for one great thing will take up a great deal of time: If he produceth a great piece, he doth not make many ſuch; if many and great, commonly they are but great <hi>Torraſſes,</hi> things of no worth, or, both botchingly and bunglingly done. Now here, in the work of Creation, is both <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Greatneſſe;</hi> here is <hi>Comelineſſe</hi> and <hi>Uſefulneſſe</hi> kiſſing each other: And yet all this ſleighted by the ſons of men, and that for ſo many years together; and yet the earth ſtandeth. Oh! the Patience of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this provocation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ye may ſee the happineſs of Chriſtians. Though the <note place="margin">3. See the happineſſe of Chriſtians.</note> world knoweth not God, there is a certain ſort of Men in the world that do: 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>God manifeſted in the Fleſh, juſtified of the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the world.</hi> Believed on in the world! This is the great priviledge of us <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew there was a God, and might come to the knowledge of ſome of his Attributes; but when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences flew in their faces, they were then at a great ſtand: They had learned that God was, and was mercifull, and that he would pardon ſin; but they had not the knowledge of a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168769:74"/> 
                  <hi>Mediator,</hi> nor how to make a friend to God. This God hath made known to them, that live under the means of grace, and hold the Miniſtry of the Goſpell. He hath let them ſee what wayes they have, to make to God. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath held forth the wayes of Truth, and Life. <note place="margin">Truth and life by Jeſus Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>No man goeth to the Father, but by Him.</hi> Therefore, if that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> of whom we read, thought he had ſo much cauſe to bleſſe God, that had made him not a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> but a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and amongſt <hi>Grecians,</hi> an <hi>Athenian;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Athenians,</hi> a <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> Certainly, we have cauſe to magnifie the grace of God, that we are born not <hi>Pagans,</hi> but <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in regard of an outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and not <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and amongſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Engliſh men.</hi> Becauſe this Iſland of ours, hath by the grace of God been the <hi>Goſhen,</hi> wherein this light of the Goſpell hath ſhined, more than in any Kingdome of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</hi> I have done with that verſe, and proceed to the Eleventh, which concerneth the Jewes eſpecially.</p>

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt is ſaid to come amongſt a people, whom <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Secondly, He came in the fleſh. <hi>This is a faithfull ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Chriſt came in the fleſh.</note> 
                  <hi>and worthy of all men to be received,</hi> ſaith Paul, 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Thus he came, He came to his owne, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the word is, and may be rendred thus. <hi>He came to his owne home.</hi> So the word is rendred, Acts 21. 6. <hi>When we had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken leave of one another, we took ſhip, and they returned</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:168769:75"/>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The ſame word in the Text. He came to his owne home, Though the earth be the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof; yet the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> was <hi>Chriſt's home</hi> in a ſpeciall manner, He dwelt there, in a more remarkable way. As it is ſaid, Pſal. 76. 1, 2. <hi>In Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah is God known, his Name is great in Iſraell, in Salem alſo is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Sion;</hi> where Chriſt's home was. And accordingly it is ſaid, Iſai. 31. ult. <hi>He ſhall paſſe over to his ſtrong hold for fear, and his Princes ſhall be afraid of the Enſigne, ſaith the Lord, whoſe fire is in Sion, and his furnace in Jeruſalem.</hi> It is a Metaphor taken from them that keep fire in their dwelling houſes. It is a ſigne that the houſe ſtandeth not empty, where fire is kept; Now ſaith he, <hi>The Lords furnace is in Jeruſalem, He dwelleth there.</hi> Therefore he is ſaid to come to his owne, when He came to them, He came to his own, that is, the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who are ſaid to be his owne in a ſpeciall manner, Pſal. 33. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is the Nation, whoſe God is the Lord, and the people, whom He hath choſen for his owne Inheritance.</hi> Here it is ſpoken of the Nation of the <hi>Jewes. And his owne received him not.</hi> That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in him. So the word is interpreted in the very next verſe, <hi>To as many as received him,</hi> that is, believed in <note place="margin">Not to receive Chriſt, is not to believe in Him.</note> his name. <hi>Received him not,</hi> that is, believed not in his name; ſo as here, that which we are to obſerve, is briefly this. Though Chriſt came to his owne, he was not received, no, not by them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He came to them, in his Ordinances; They had the <note place="margin">1. How in his Ordinances.</note> Miniſtry of the word. <hi>He hath not dealt ſo with every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Pſal. 147. ult. <hi>Neither have the Heathen knowledge of his wayes, but he ſheweth his word to Jacob, and his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and judgments to Iſraell.</hi> Chriſt came in his word. The Scripture is but the ſhell, Chriſt is the kernell; The Scripture is the Cabinet, Chriſt is the Jewell. <hi>Scripturae ſunt faſciae, in quibus involutus eſt puer Jeſus.</hi> This the <hi>Prince of Antwerpe</hi> was wont to ſay. The Scriptures are the ſwadling Cloaths, in which Chriſt is wrapt. So Chriſt came in the word, in a great many perſonall types, that did fore-ſignifie him. He came in <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> He himſelfe <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:168769:75"/> being the true King of Righteouſneſſe, the King of peace. He came in <hi>Joſhua,</hi> he being the true <hi>Leader</hi> of men into the heavenly Canaan. He came in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he being the true <note place="margin">Joſhua 4. 19. Gen. 18. 12. Gen. 22. 6.</note> Son of Laughter; The cauſe of his peoples joy, bearing his owne Croſſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bore the Wood. So in all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall Types, He came in the Sacrifices under the Law, they all ſignified Him. Therefore they offered the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Evening Sacrifice. The Evening ſacrifice was offered at the ſame hour, in which Chriſt was after nailed to the Croſſe. And he did ſo purpoſely to make it appear, that He came to fulfill all thoſe Sacrifice. He came in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Lamb ſlain. The paſſe-over was a Type of Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt our paſſe-over, was ſacrificed for us.</hi> Manna, was a Type of him. And ſo the water in the Rock, that was Chriſt. So he came in his Ordinances to the Jewes, but they did not receive him. Let two <hi>Prophets</hi> anſwer that, Iſa. 8. 12. <hi>I have written to him,</hi> ſpeaking of Ephraim, <hi>the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing;</hi> Chriſt came in the Word, and they looked at the word, as if it concerned not them, they accompted it as a ſtrange thing: this for the Law. And for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whereof <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a <hi>Preacher</hi> in that age, the moſt <hi>Evangelicall</hi> of all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> ſee what he ſaith, Iſa. 53. 1. <hi>Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> Here is Chriſt, comes to his owne in his Ordinances, and not received; the report of him, not believed; his Law accompted, a ſtrange thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt in the fleſh, The word was made fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. How in the fleſh.</note> 
                  <hi>and dwelt amongſt us;</hi> He converſed in the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> This was an act of ſpeciall favour. For one to receive a man into his houſe, is a favour: What was it for Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>man himſelfe,</hi> to aſſume the <hi>Manhood</hi> into one and the ſame Perſon, into the <hi>Godhead?</hi> yet this he did. He came to his owne, did they receive him? Search the Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſome kind of reception there was, when He was born. But what?

This, for the Explication of it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, it hinteth us to a conſiderable Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel <note place="margin">1. Chriſt not received, nor Antichriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</note> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in regard of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, and was to be received; <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi> was to come, and to be ſhunned. The Scripture had foretold, that Chriſt ſhould come, when the Scepter ſhould depart from <hi>Judah.</hi> Therefore, about that time, they began <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> to look <hi>for the Conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Simeon</hi> and the reſt <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 25.</note> did. 2 Theſſ. 2. 7. <hi>When that which withholds is taken out of the way, then the man of perdition ſhall be revealed.</hi> Accordingly, Chriſt came at his time, and Antichriſt came at his time; and yet neither was Chriſt received, nor Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhunned, as he ſhould have been: and all upon a falſe ſurmiſe. They looked not at Chriſt at that time, but as a temporall <hi>Monarch,</hi> therefore they received him not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came in a mean condition. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> came in his time: up-ſtarts the <hi>Pope,</hi> when the <hi>Emperour</hi> went down. But they looked for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as a Tyrant, that ſhould with fire and ſword over-run the world; but he came in ſheep's <note place="margin">Antichriſt's hypocriticall deluſion.</note> cloathing, as a <hi>Lamb;</hi> therefore they ſhunn'd him not, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this miſtake onely. As ſome godly <hi>Jews,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, gave him entertainment as the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> ſo when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> came, ſome believers were ſtirred up to cry out, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and ſo to write againſt him from his firſt riſe. After <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had been in the world a while, people began to ſmell him out, and diſcover him; and whole Churches fell from him, as many of theſe We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Churches have done. So, a time is comming, that Chriſt ſhall be diſcovered to the Jews, and they ſhall mourn over him. Thus the Parallel, you ſee, runneth throughout. That, by the way.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:168769:76"/>
               <p> Secondly, We may here ſee our own Pictures, in the <note place="margin">2. We may ſee our own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to Chriſt, by the deportment of the Jews.</note> Jews carriage towards Chriſt: <hi>As face in water anſwereth face, ſo the face of man to man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Juſt ſuch are we to Chriſt as they were. He is come to us, and we have not received him; he comes in his Ordinances, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him not. We cry ſhame of the Jews, and we our ſelves are as bad. We have our <hi>Gadarenes,</hi> that prefer their ſwine before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their baſe ſwiniſh luſts before our Saviour. We have them that cry out, <hi>Not Chriſt, but Barabbas;</hi> not Chriſt, but the world. Never let men, that walk in waies of diſobedience, pretend their receiving of him. They ſay, perhaps, What would you have? We are baptized in the waies of Chriſt, and come to the Lord's Table, and hear the Word Preached. But what do we more than many of the Jews did, who are ſaid, not to have received him? They flockt after Chriſt, but it was to ſee his Miracles; whole troops flockt after Chriſt, and yet they received him not: Why? Becauſe they obeyed him not, nor believed in him. It is not all our formalities and profeſſion, that will make us to paſſe as receivers of Chriſt, if we do not obey hit Goſpell. If a Soveraign Prince ſhall ſend his Agent or Ambaſſador into ſome part of his own dominions, he will expect, that this Agent of his ſhould have a fair acception: It will not be enough for the people to ſuffer him to land, to provide a fair houſe, and to make good entertainment for him, and give him reſpect; no, they are not ſaid to receive ſuch an Agent from the King, unleſſe they obey the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he bringeth them from his Soveraign. So, we are not ſaid to receive Jeſus Chriſt, unleſſe we yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him. As a man taketh adultery a great deal worſe in his wife than in his kinſwoman, than in his daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is married to him, and becauſe he is nearer to her. The Churches that profeſſe Chriſt, they are the Spouſe of <note place="margin">The Church's near relation to Chriſt.</note> Chriſt; and for a Spouſe to play the harlot is far worſe, than for them that are at a greater diſtance from him. <hi>If Iſrael ſin, yet let not Judah tranſgreſſe.</hi> If <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry, and ſin, yet let not <hi>England</hi> play the harlot. Let us not act the parts of the Jews with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is a word of Comfort alſo here, to ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168769:77"/> by their own for Chriſt's ſake; that is an uſuall caſe, it is that which Chriſt foretold, Matth. 10. 35, 36. <hi>I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father, and the daughter againſt her mother, and the daughter in law againſt her mother in law, and a man's foes ſhall be they of his own houſe.</hi> Here is a diviſion made by Chriſt's comming. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that thoſe of his own houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, many times, do not receive him, after he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt. It is the caſe of many a poor ſoul to be frowned upon, and to meet with hard uſage, becauſe of his going after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Ordinances. Here is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, It is that which befell Chriſt, His own received him not. Therefore if thy own reject thee, it is no ſuch wonder. It is ſaid of our Saviours friends, and near kinsfolk, Joh. 11. 5. <hi>Neither did his brethren believe on him.</hi> They were thoſe of his neareſt kinſmen; <hi>Mary's ſiſter's ſons, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> they were believers indeed; but the reſt of his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, many of them, even his very brethren, believed not in him. Nay, ſo far were they from believing in him, that, as we read it, they were mightily miſtaken about him; <hi>When his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him, for they ſaid he was beſides himſelf.</hi> The words well bear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other interpretation; but, according to this, his very friends had a conceit, that Chriſt was mad, as many now adaies. Saith the unbelieving husband, I think my wife is mad; and ſaith the unbelieving wife, I think my husband is beſides himſelf, when he goeth after the waies of God. Let us be content to loſe our ſelves, to be conformed to Chriſt. As <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, <hi>Riſu ludentes, &amp; joco, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe that ſpend their time in laughing and jollity, they cannot accompany the tears of Chriſt. They that affect the high places, cannot be accompanied with the humility of Chriſt, for his humility comforteth the lowly. And he being not received of his own, comforteth thoſe which are comfortleſſe for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>I have done now with this Verſe. The next commeth in by way of an Anſwer to an Objection, thus: If the world knew him not, and his own received him not, then Chriſt came in vain. No, ſaith the Evangeliſt, there were ſome that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168769:77"/> received him, and to purpoſe too; for they became the ſons of God by receiving of him.</p>

               <p>What uſe ſhall we make of it?</p>
               <p>Firſt, examine whether we be thus preferred, yea, or <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>1</label> no. It is that, which almoſt every one in the viſible Church <note place="margin">Examine our ſelves wherher we be ſons or not.</note> pretendeth to be, a ſon, and daughter of God. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, worth the while to try, whether the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath made us partakers of this priviledge. It is a uſe both for the aſſurance of the Saints, and for the diſcarding of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits, that are but pretenders to it. They favour even thoſe men, of whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>You are of your father the Devill.</hi> They pretend ſonſhip to God, Joh. 8. 41. <hi>We,</hi> ſay they, <hi>be not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God.</hi> And yet Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>ye are of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Devill.</hi> We are of God, ſay they: ye are of your father the Devill, ſaith Chriſt. One way to try this, and the onely one that I will name, is by the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>If we be ſons, then God hath ſent forth into our hearts the ſpirit of adoption, by which we cry Abba, Father.</hi> This ye have expreſſely laid down in ſo many words, Gal. 4. 6. <hi>Becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba father.</hi> Whereſoever there is ſonſhip, there will be crying, <hi>Abba</hi> Father. Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168769:80"/> implyeth <hi>fervency of ſpirit;</hi> as, <hi>Why cryeſt thou to me?</hi> faith God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was in a great ſtrait at the Red-ſea. Becauſe both the profane perſons, and formall profeſſors, will put on for a ſhare; before we can break the childrens bread, we muſt diſcard them from the comforts of this. If crying, Father, and if praying, argue my ſonſhip, <note place="margin">Formality and Prophaneneſs reproved.</note> then I am a ſon, ſaith the profane perſon; for I ſay my prayers ever and anon. Alas, what is this to the purpoſe? Thy praying is but craving, yea, thy praying is but houling in God's eſteem, Iſa. 7. 14. <hi>They have not cryed to me with their hearts, when they houled upon their beds.</hi> How irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom is the houling of dogs to the ears of men? ſuch is that, which profane perſons call Praying, in the ears of God. The truth is, their praying is but a driving of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe their life, all the while, giveth their tongue the lie. <hi>Our Father</hi> (ſaith the profane perſon) <hi>which art in heaven;</hi> and in the mean while, he ſerveth his father the devill which is in hell. <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> ſo ſay his lips, but in the mean time, he diſhonoureth God in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lying, and whoring, and drinking, and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Thy kingdom come;</hi> and in the mean while, he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Kingdom of Chriſt in his heart, and in the lives of his Saints, and doth what he can to hinder the comming of it. <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven;</hi> and in the mean while, he doth the will of Satan, that will which the damned do in hell. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly acknowledging, that he receiveth all, even his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies, from God; and in the mean while, perhaps, ſacrificeth to his own net, commending his own skill for the eſtate he hath gotten. <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that treſpaſſe againſt us;</hi> and in the mean while, he goeth on in malice and envy, ſinning to his very hour of death, as it were. <hi>Lead us not into temptation;</hi> in the mean while, he tempteth the devill to tempt him. He cryeth, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from evill,</hi> and delivereth himſelf up to evill while he ſaith ſo: He layeth the reins upon the neck of his luſts, that run away with him into all miſchief. Call you this praying? I but, ſaith the formall profeſſor, I pray, and that frequently; not in diſtreſs onely, but, haply, keep a conſtant
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168769:80"/> courſe of prayer. Surely I muſt go for a child of God.</p>
               <p>That we be not deceived, let us conſider, It is one thing to draw nigh with the heart, and another thing to draw nigh with the lips. You know the complaint of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> compare two places together, Iſa. 1. 15. <hi>When ye ſo read forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; and when you make many prayers I will not hear you.</hi> And yet he complaineth of them by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 4. They make many prayers, and yet none heareth that prayer: Why? Becauſe, Iſa. 29. 13. <hi>This people draw near to me with their mouths, but remove their hearts far from me.</hi> Therefore they pray, and their prayers are no prayers, becauſe their hearts are not in them. I will not deny, but many a formall profeſſor may have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the gift of prayer, but that which I make an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sonſhip, was a ſpirit of prayer, the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which we cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> What that is, ye may ſee, Zach. 10. 12. <hi>I will pour out upon Jeruſalem the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication.</hi> How worketh that? <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and mourn for me, as one mourneth for his onely ſon.</hi> Whereſoever the ſpirit <note place="margin">Spirituall Prayer looks up to Chriſt.</note> of prayer is, there will be a looking up to Jeſus Chriſt in all our devotions. The ſpirit of Adoption, that commeth from the Son, guideth to the Son, and taketh us along with him in all our addreſſes to God. They that would have their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to reſound, will make choice of Rocky places, which ſend forth the beſt Eccho. This Rock, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is he, that maketh our prayers to return with a bleſſing into our own boſoms. You ſhall have many men that go to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and leave Chriſt behind them; What a poor devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is here? The ſpirit of prayer is alwaies accompanied with Evangelicall humility, with a mourning that floweth from our looking to Chriſt. I know, there is a great deal of legall ſorrow in formall profeſſors. Men may go blubbering to hell, without true repentance. But here is a mourning, that floweth from a looking up to Chriſt. Where there is a ſpirit of Adoption, men will ſpeak from feeling, which floweth from the apprehenſion of Chriſt, and the certainty of God's grace in him. Now, this ſpirit of Adoption argueth Sonſhip.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:168769:81"/>
               <p> But then commeth in the poor weak Believer, and ſaith, <label type="milestone">

                  </label> I am undone. The other plead for themſelves without a cauſe, and he pleadeth as much againſt himſelf without a cauſe. I cannot find ſuch enlargement in prayer: Surely the Spirit of Adoption is not in me; if it were, I ſhould cry <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father</hi> with more importunity.</p>
               <p>All Believers are not alike gifted, there may be a gift of <label type="milestone">

Ye read there of a ſon that ſerveth. Indeed, the beſt ſervice God hath done him, is by his ſons; all other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are little worth in compariſon. <hi>I will ſpare him, as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> The ſon goeth naturally and ingenuouſly about his father's work; he doth it kindly, much more kindly than a ſervant will, that doth it onely for his wages. Therefore of old, they were wont to ſet their children to the work. The chief work lay in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. We read of <hi>Rachel</hi>'s keeping her father's ſheep, <note place="margin">Gen 29. 6.</note> and ſo of <hi>Jacob</hi> keeping his father in law's ſheep.

Doth not he tell us, <hi>That he that provideth not for his owne family, is the worſt of Infidells?</hi> Ye are of Gods family, therefore be ſure, He will provide for you, if ye truſt Him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It teacheth us a leſſon of Patience, Hebr. 12. <note place="margin">4. It teacheth us to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> 5. <hi>Forget not the exhortation which ſpeaketh to you, as Children. My ſon deſpiſe not thou the Chaſtiſements of the Lord; For whom the Lord loveth, He chaſtiſeth.</hi> Faint not under the correction of a Father, and, becauſe it is from a Father that will lay on no more, no longer, than the Child ſtandeth in need of it. Herein, that of our Saviour ſhould be often in our thoughts, Joh. 18. 11. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> Why, every affliction that befalleth me, is a Cup out of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand, and from Him I ſhould take it, and drink it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is mixed by Him, who will be ſure to put no poyſon into his Children's Cup.</p>
               <p>Fithly, It ſhould teach us a leſſon of reverence, <hi>If I</hi>

                  <hi>be a Father,</hi> Mal. 1. 6. <hi>A ſon honoreth his father, and a ſervant his maſter; If then I be a father, where is mine honour?</hi> The children that will be playing the waggs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily together; if the father come into their preſence, he huſheth all the noiſe; and the reſpect they bear him, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them off from their vanity. The Reverence we owe to God, ſhould take us off from all unſeemly Carriages. It was a report made of <hi>Luther,</hi> by one that lived much with him, and obſerved his devotion; <hi>Tanta reverentia cum Deo, &amp; Tanta fiducia cum Patre.</hi> He goeth to God, ſaith he, with ſo much reverence, as a man that cometh to a Lord above him; but with ſo much confidence, as a man that goeth to a Father, <note place="margin">6. It teacheth us to ſeperate from the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the World.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, It ſhould teach us a leſſon of ſeperation from the folly, and iniquity of the World; This ye have in that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168769:82"/> place, 2 Cor. 6. and the two laſt verſes. <hi>Come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and be ye ſeparated, and touch no unclean thing, and I will be a father to you.</hi> God expecteth a great deal of holineſſe in his Children, that they ſhould nor run into the like exceſſe of Riot, with the men of the World. We ſhould all be ſeparatiſts in this ſenſe, namely, from the pollutions of the world; we ſhould not behave our ſelves unbeſeeming the ſons and daughters of God. It was an excellent advice given by a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> to a young <hi>Prince</hi> under his Tuition, and Care. The Prince was to go abroad into a place, where he knew he ſhould meet with ſome naughty Company; he deſired his Tutor, to teach him how he ſhould govern, and behave himſelfe. He giveth him this rule. <hi>Memento, te ſilium eſſe Regis;</hi> Remember, Thou art a King's ſon: when thou comeſt there, do nothing but what becometh the ſon of a King. Could we alwayes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this <hi>Memento</hi> along with us, how pure would our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations be? Thou art a ſon and daughter of God, be ſure to do nothing unbeſeeming this relation, and thou wilt do well enough. Is this thy ſon's Coat, ſay they to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> when they brought it home imbrew'd with blood? When we ſee a mans Carriage defiled with luſt, and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and bitterneſſe, is this the Coat of a Son? is it the badge of an heir of Heaven, and Child of God? He that will do nothing unworthy of this relation, muſt be ſure to walk unſpotted of the World. Thus, I have run over the Obſervations, that flow from the firſt particular of the Text, namely, <hi>The benefit; The power, or priviledge, or preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to become the ſons of God.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, The next thing is, The <hi>Benefactor,</hi> that is <note place="margin">2. Chriſt our Benefactor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth power to become ſons.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt.

Hath not one God created us?</hi> Nor onely ſons by <hi>profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſo all the members of the viſible Church are, Gen. 6. 2. <hi>The Sons of God ſaw the daughters of men.</hi> Nor one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſons by <hi>Deputation;</hi> So all Magiſtrates are, according to that, Pſal. 82. 6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, and all of you ſons of the moſt High.</hi> But ſons of God by <hi>adoption.</hi> That which
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168769:83"/> the Apoſtle telleth us of, Gal. 4, 5. <hi>That we might receive the Adoption of ſons.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>naturall adoption.</hi> That belonged properly to the <note place="margin">Naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of the Jewes.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>perſonall adoption,</hi> that of which <note place="margin">Perſonall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</note> I told you, out of Gal. 4. 6. <hi>As many as received Him, gave He the priviledge to become the ſons of God.</hi> Here is the <hi>benefit,</hi> and the <hi>Benefactor.</hi> He gave it, it is the gift of Chriſt, He made us adopted Sons.</p>

The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon whom God the Father beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chtiſt.</note> the gift of Chriſt, being deſcribed by their faith. I ſhall wrap up all in this one Obſervation, which will take in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the verſe; namely that, <hi>It is given to all ſuch, as truly receive Chriſt by faith, to become the ſons of God, by adoption.</hi> For the explication whereof, four things are to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                  </label> be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Chriſt ſhould be received. <hi>To as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That to the true receiving of Chriſt, there muſt be a ſpeciall concurrence of Faith, <hi>Even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That all ſuch as do receive Chriſt by faith, are adopted ones. To <hi>them gave He power to become the ſons of God, as many as received Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, That this ſonſhip is a free gift. <hi>He hath given them power to become the ſons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe all lie clearly in the words: when I have explained them, I ſhall come to apply them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be received, Col. 2. 6. <hi>As ye</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Chriſt ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and how.</note> 
                  <hi>have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:168769:83"/> 
                  <hi>in him.</hi> Walk in him, but receive him firſt. Therefore it is, that Chriſt is compared to ſuch things in Scripture, as do import a receiving of him, conveying of him to mens ſouls. He is called the <hi>Bread of life,</hi> Joh. 6. 35. If bread be not eaten, it nouriſheth not; if Chriſt be not received, he ſaveth not. We are ſaid to put him on as a garment, <hi>As many as have received Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> A garment muſt be taken and applied to the body, or it cannot warm it, to ſence it from the weather. He is ſaid <hi>to come with healing under his wings,</hi> Mal. 4. 2. Chriſt bringeth medicines with him, ſalves for ſores, medicines for diſeaſes. But the ſalve muſt be applied to the ſore, elſe the ſalve healeth not; and the medicine to the diſeaſe, elſe it cureth not. Chriſt is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of our ſouls, <hi>Thy Maker is thy husband.</hi> By marriage, there muſt be a mutuall receiving of each other, elſe it is no marriage. All theſe expreſſions imply the receiving of Chriſt; and not to receive him, is the greateſt folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world. As, Who would not think that man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, that, having a violent diſeaſe upon him, when the beſt medicine in the world ſhal be offered him, and which will infallibly cure him, ſhall refuſe to take it? That is our caſe. We are all ſick, ſick to death; and the Lord Chriſt is offered to us in the Goſpell? Is it not madneſſe to refuſe him? If a poor woman, that were deep in debt, ſhould have a Serjeant come upon her, and arreſt her, and be dragging of her to priſon; and, at the ſame time, ſhould have a good march offered to her, a rich husband, that will pay all her debts; Were not ſhe an unwiſe woman, if ſhe would not take him for her husband? It is our caſe: We are all deep in God's debt, ready to be dragged to the priſon of hell, there to lie and die, and rot for ever. Now the Lord Jeſus offereth to take us, and to be married to us: And for us to refuſe him, who will pay all our debts, and advance us to an high and glorious condition; Is it not madneſſe? And yet there is no greater, and more common and frequent ſin <note place="margin">To refuſe Chriſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is the great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſin.</note> in the world, than this. The not receiving Chriſt, it is the great damning ſin. It is this that argueth the prophaneneſſe of man's heart, as <hi>Eſau</hi> is called prophane; Why? Becauſe he ſold his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage; the brand of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168769:84"/> prophanneſſe is faſtned upon him in this reſpect. So, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe is in the hearts of all the ungodly, they ſell their birth-right for ſome meſſe or other of the devill's pottage, for pleaſures or profits. They let Chriſt go, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas;</hi> not Chriſt, but credit; not Chriſt, but wealth and eſtate. Therefore ſtill the Lord hath occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of men, that they would not receive him: <hi>Ye would not come to me, that ye might have life,</hi> and ſonſhip. This is laid for the firſt ground, Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be received. If he be not, it proceedeth from the folly of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To the true receiving of Chriſt, there muſt be <note place="margin">2. A ſpeciall Concurrence to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt.</note> a ſpeciall Concurrence of Faith. <hi>As many as received him.</hi> Who are they? Believers, <hi>That believed in his Name.</hi> In his Name. <hi>Name,</hi> in the Scripture, is often put for <hi>Perſon,</hi> as, Rev. 3. 4. <hi>Thou haſt a few names in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments;</hi> that is, a few men and women, a few perſons. The Receivers of Chriſt are ſaid to believe in his name, becauſe the direct object of their faith is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, for this or that purpoſe. That Chriſt died for all, or for me, or for the elect onely, It is not the believing of any of theſe Propoſitions, that ſaveth; but in Chriſt. The Perſon of Chriſt, his Name is the object of faith. <hi>Believed in his Name,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It is a known diſtinction amongſt Divines, that of <hi>Credere Deum, Credere Deo, &amp;, Credere in Deum.</hi> It is one thing to believe that there is a God, that is, <hi>Credere Deum;</hi> ſo the devills believe, and tremble. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing, <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> to believe God, that is, what God ſaith, to be true. But that which ſaveth is, <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> to believe in God. That is, <hi>Cedere credendo in Deum;</hi> By believing to paſſe into God, and cleave to him, and cloſe with him. So the ſame may be ſaid of Chriſt, It is one thing, <hi>credere Chriſtum,</hi> to believe that Chriſt is; and another thing, <hi>credere Chriſto,</hi> to believe what Chriſt hath ſaid in the word of truth; but another thing, <hi>credere in Chriſtum,</hi> to believe in Chriſt. Joh. 14. 10, 11, 12. ye ſhall find all theſe, <hi>Believeſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</hi> Here is <hi>credere Chriſtum,</hi> to believe that Chriſt is, and what he is; that he is in the Father, and the Father in him. Verſ. 11. <hi>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:168769:84"/> 
                  <hi>the Father in me.</hi> That is, <hi>credere Chriſto,</hi> becauſe he hath ſaid it. Verſ. 12. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, the works that I do ſhall he do alſo.</hi> Here is <hi>credere in Chriſtum,</hi> that is the faith in the Text, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the true receiving of Chriſt,<hi>—believed in his Name.</hi> Believing on him, that is, relying upon him. Faith lyeth in recumbency, therefore faith, the act of faith, is often expreſſed in Scripture by acts of relying, and ſtaying our ſelves upon God; 2 Chron. 16. 7. 8. <hi>becauſe thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed on the King of Aſſyria, and not on the Lord thy God; therefore is the hoſte of the King of Aſſyria eſcaped from thy hands. Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a great hoſt, with very many chariots and horſemen? Yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou didſt rely on the Lord, he delivered them into thy hands.</hi> Here is <hi>believing</hi> expreſt by <hi>relying</hi> on the Lord. That in caſe of a temporall deliverance, faith exerciſeth the ſame kind of act, as, towards God, in ſpiritualls: Iſa. 10. 20. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in that day, that the remnant of Iſrael, and ſuch as have eſcaped of the houſe of Jacob, ſhall no more again ſtay upon him that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, in truth.</hi> Here is belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his Name, relying upon, and ſtaying on Chriſt. And God hath been pleaſed to make faith the inſtrument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, for two reaſons, intimated by the Apoſtle, Rom. 4. 16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Faith the Inſtrument of receiving Chriſt, both to juſtifie and to ſave.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith is choſen out from all other graces, to be the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt, to Juſtification, and to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it might be of grace, that the free grace of God might more appear in this way of diſpenſation. If God ſhould have choſen Love, or Zeal, or Hope, or any other Grace; this would carry ſome ſhew of worth and merit in it, and bring ſomething to God with it: Whereas Faith is an emptying Grace, bringeth nothing but an empty hand, that God might fill it. And therefore it is of faith, that it might be ſo much the more of grace; becauſe faith is a meer naked Receiver. In point of Sanctification, faith is a purger and worker; but in point of Juſtification, it is a meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver: And that magnifieth the grace of God ſo much the more, that it might be of grace.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:168769:85"/>
               <p> Secondly, That the Promiſe might be ſure. Should God <note place="margin">2. Salvation dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Faith, that the Promiſe might be ſure.</note> have hanged our Salvation upon any other Condition than of faith, Believers could never have attained that aſſurance, which they may now arive at, by the help of the Spirit of grace: Why? Becauſe God requireth nothing of us now, but the taking of Chriſt, as to point of Juſtification. Should the Condition have been our <hi>Obedience,</hi> as under the firſt Covenant of works, <hi>Do this, and live;</hi> Though God had treated with us upon very low tearms, Never be drunk in thy life, and thou ſhalt be ſaved; Forbear adultery and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and thou ſhalt be ſaved; the Promiſe would not have been ſure, no man durſt have truſted himſelf, no, not in this thing. We know how <hi>David,</hi> and other ſervants of God, have been ſeduced and fallen. But take and receive Chriſt, and he will be thy Saviour; here is the way for aſſurance. As, put caſe you come to a beggar, and ſay, Do ſuch a piece of ſervice for me, and thou ſhalt have ſuch a reward; there ye put him upon a greater difficulty, than to give him ſo much mony. So God dealeth with us. Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved; Receive, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All that truly receive Chriſt by faith, are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">3. By Faith we are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt.</note> ones; <hi>To as many as received him, gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſons of God:</hi> Not by <hi>Creation</hi> onely, as all men are; nor by <hi>Profeſſion</hi> onely, as all the Members of the viſible Church are; nor by <hi>Deputation</hi> onely, as all Magiſtrates are, <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are gods, and the ſons of the moſt high:</hi> But by <hi>Adoption, that ye might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> All that receive Chriſt are thus adopted: For which ye have a clear place, Gal. 3. 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>For ye are all the ſons of God in Chriſt Jeſus. For all ye that are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt. There is neither Jew nor Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus. And if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs by promiſe.</hi> It is ſaid by the Apoſtle, Rom. 9. ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>to them belonged the adoption,</hi> ſpeaking there of a <hi>Nationall</hi> adoption, that belonged to the Jews, the onely peculiar Nation of the world, that God had then pickt out, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelf among. But hereupon the Jews were apt to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:168769:85"/> conceive, that none had right to be the ſons and daughters of God, but thoſe of their Nation. What was true of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> adoption, they uſed to apply it to <hi>Perſonall,</hi> and called themſelves the children of God, becauſe they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father. Now, ſaith the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> here, <hi>All,</hi> without any difference, that have received Chriſt, they are ſons, as well as the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> by a naturall generation, becauſe they are all of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith, and ſo come to be heirs of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed. He telleth them here, <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek.</hi> A believing <hi>Greek</hi> is as true a child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea, of God, as a believing <hi>Jew;</hi> and much more than an unbelieving <hi>Jew,</hi> that braggeth ſo much of being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed. <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek nor bond nor free.</hi> Chriſt findeth men in a ſtate of bondage, and leaveth them ſo, haply, in worldly reſpects, but he maketh them free in reſpect of God: <hi>If the Son ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you free, then are ye free indeed. There is neither male nor female.</hi> In ſome Common-wealths, Females are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the chief Dignity, as by the <hi>Salique Law</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> no Woman can inherit a Crown. In all Common-wealths, they are ſecluded from many Offices, which are proper onely to men. But when you come to ſpeak of the Dignity of Adoption, <hi>Females</hi> come in as well as <hi>Males.</hi> Every Believer is a partaker of this high priviledge, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the child of God. That is the importance of this word in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>As many as received him. All, and every one that receiveth him, become the ſons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Adoption of ſons is a free gift: <hi>As many</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. It is the free gift of God, that we are adopted ſons.</note>

                  </gap>, <hi>He gave them power to become.</hi> It's an Ingredient into the very eſſence of <hi>Adoption, It muſt be free.</hi> So the civill Law defineth Adoption, <hi>Gratuita eſt aſſumptio, non habentis jus;</hi> It is a free Aſſumption of a perſon, that hath no right to an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, to the partaking of that Inheritance. As, what right had <hi>Moſes,</hi> a poor Hebrew child, that was thrown out in an Ark of Bulruſhes, ready to periſh; what right had he to that Eſtate that belonged to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter, till ſhe adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and gave him that? So <hi>Mordechai</hi> adopted <hi>Heſter.</hi>

That is here, even the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>an Inheritance with the Saints in light.</hi> Hence it is, that, that bleſſedneſſe, which the Saints ſhall injoy in the ſtate of Glory, is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>The adoption,</hi> becauſe it is that, which we are adopted to. And ſo I underſtand that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. where Adoption is taken in that ſenſe, waiting for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption; <hi>We which have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, we our ſelves groane within our ſelves, waiting for the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> That is, for that glory, we are adopted to, for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which God hath promiſed us. Otherwiſe, men which receive the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, they receive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption in this ſenſe. But here is a further thing, which they have not yet, but wait for, which is called <hi>Adoption,</hi> even the Conſummation of all their hopes, the Inheritance in glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As in every adoption there muſt be ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; <note place="margin">2. It muſt be of a party, that hath no right to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> ſo adoption muſt be of a party, that hath no right to that Inheritance. A man is not ſaid to adopt his owne ſon, becauſe nature giveth him a right to his father's eſtate. But if he adopteth, it is a ſtranger. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a ſtranger to <hi>Pharoahs</hi> daughter. <hi>Heſter,</hi> though ſhe were akin to <hi>Mordecay,</hi> yet was not his naturall daughter, and therefore was adopted by him. We are all by nature ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and a great deal worſe, enemies to God, as well as ſtrangers, we have no right, no ſhew of right to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>for we all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 23.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It muſt be <hi>Gratuita Aſſumptio.</hi> A free aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of a perſon that hath no right, and the having no <note place="margin">3. It muſt be of a perſon that hath no right.</note> right, ſheweth it to be free. And that we are ſure, is to be found in this Divine Inheritance. It is an act of God's free grace, nothing moved him but his owne free love. God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:168769:86"/> becauſe he loveth; and hath mercy on whom, he will have mercy. See this proceeding from free grace, Epheſ. 1. 5, 6. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his Will.</hi> Here is the good pleaſure of God's will, the onely ground of our adoption. Thus I have run through the four things, which I undertook for the explication of this point.</p>
               <p>Come we now to apply it. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, let us all learn from hence to extoll, and magnifie, <note place="margin">1. Learn to glorifie God, for ſo great a gift, as adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> and adore the goodneſſe and bounty of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; in giving the poor ſons of men, ſo great, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a gift as this of adoption is. <hi>To them that receive Him, to them gave He power,</hi> dignity, priviledge, prerogative, <hi>to become the ſons of God.</hi> You ſee it is a free gift. Look to all the progreſſe of ſalvation, from firſt to laſt, and you ſhall find free grace running through every paſſage of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, even as blood runs through every vein in the body of a man. Chriſt himſelfe is the great gift of God, and all other things are the gift of Chriſt; God together with him, giveth us all things elſe. Have we any newneſſe of heart in us? It is He that giveth it. He taketh away the heart of ſtone, and giveth an heart of fleſh. Have we Miniſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods owne heart? It is God that giveth the increaſe. Have we any thing to ſuffer, or to do? <hi>To you it is given to believe, and to ſuffer.</hi> To the firſt, This great priviledge of Adoption. What but free, and undeſerved love could have moved Chriſt, to beſtow ſuch a favour upon us? He himſelfe was the onely begotten Son of God, and might have contented himſelfe with this dignity for ever, and yet He is pleaſed to become <hi>the firſt begotten of many Brethren.</hi> The naturall Son of God made way for the poor ſons of men, that they might receive the adoption of ſons. It is a greater favour then any <hi>Adam</hi> had, to thank God for, this, that we receive from Chriſt; <hi>Adam</hi> was rather in the condition of a <hi>ſervant,</hi> then of a <hi>Son.</hi> He lived under the Covenant of works; <hi>Do this, and live.</hi> And therefore it was, that <hi>Adam</hi> was in a poſſibility of falling from his happy Condition, as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:168769:87"/> ye know he did, and of being turned out of the houſe, <hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever, but the ſon abideth for ever,</hi> Joh. 8. 35. If ye will ſay, he was a ſon, as indeed he was, it was but a ſon by Creation. He bore the Image of God, had the divine ſtamp upon him, but here is a further ſonſhip by adoption. There is a myſticall union of believers to Chriſt, as their head; which <hi>Adam</hi> had not. But if ye will diſtinctly ſee the heighth, and excellency of this priviledge, that ſo we might know, what we have to bleſſe, and magnifie Chriſt for, ſo much the clearer; Let us compare this <hi>Divine adoption</hi> with <hi>Civill adoptions,</hi> which are in uſe amongſt the ſons of men. And ſee how farre this Excellency reacheth, in four or five particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in Civill adoption, there is alwayes ſome need on <note place="margin">1. In civill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, there is ſome need on the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's part.</note> the Adopter's part. No man will go, and take a ſtranger's ſon; and adopt him, unleſſe he want a ſon of his own; or unleſſe his owne ſon be ſo unworthy, as he thinketh him not fit to be truſted with an eſtate. But it is ſeldome done, but in caſe of <hi>Orphany,</hi> where there wanteth Children. The law ſaith, That adoption is, <hi>Actus lega is, naturam ſequens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A legall act, Imitating nature, Invented for the comfort of them, that have no Children of their owne.</hi> But now look to this ſpirituall adoption, and ye ſhall find God had no need, he had a ſon of his owne. The Son of his boſome, the Son of his love, the Son of his delights, in whom he did take pleaſure from all Eternity, and might have taken pleaſure to all Eternity; though there had been no ſuch Creature as Man, made in the World. And yet He was pleaſed to adopt the ſons of men, not becauſe He wanted a ſon, but becauſe we wanted a Father. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this reſpect, we have great cauſe to ſay as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth, <hi>Behold, what manner of Love, the Father hath ſhewed us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God?</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is commonly on the Adopted his part, <note place="margin">2. On the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted his part, there is expected ſome worth.</note> ſome worth. As there is ſome need on the part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopter, ſo ſome worth in the Adopted. When men make their choice, either they have regard to ſome excellency, or ſome relation, or ſomething that is a motive to their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168769:87"/> to pitch upon ſuch a child, rather than another, to adopt for an heir. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s daughter adopted <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Moſes</hi> his beauty moved her; the Text giveth you that hint, Act. 7. 20. <hi>Moſes was exceeding fair. When he was caſt out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed him for her own ſon.</hi> The very beauty of the <hi>Child</hi> had an operation upon the <hi>Lady</hi>'s heart. So <hi>Mordechai</hi> adopted <hi>Heſter:</hi> What was the reaſon? Firſt, ſhe was near akin to him; then, very beautifull, Heſt. 2. 7. <hi>He brought up Haddaſſah (which is Heſter) his uncle's daughter, for ſhe had neither father nor mother; and the maid was fair and beautifull, whom Mordechai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</hi> So, here is ſomething in the Adopted, that moveth the Adopter: But what is in us to move God? unleſſe we ſpeak of moving him to indignation. Beauty we have none, for we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed all over with ſin, over-ſpread with a leproſie; all our faculties are in ſin, and all ſin is in our faculties; our very Righteouſneſſe is as a menſtruous cloath, What then are our Abhominations? Our Civilities and Formalities are but as dung, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> accounts of all for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> If they are but as dung, What then are our oaths, and lies, and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Lord's day? The truth is, we have nothing lovely in us, and yet behold, we are called the ſons of God: What love is here?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The adopting father may leave an Eſtate, but <note place="margin">3. The Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot convey a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate rightly.</note> he cannot convey a diſpoſition to him, whom he adopteth, to inable to manage it aright; therefore is there often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: they think they pitch well, and it proveth ill. Such as are adopted, they come leightly by their eſtates, and they ſet leightly by them. But herein lyeth a further and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er excellency of this divine Adoption, God, together with an Inheritance, conveyeth a Diſpoſition, that rendreth one fit for the managing of ſuch an eſtate. Ye have an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſoundeth that way, Col. 1. 12. <hi>Giving thanks to the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> He doth not onely give us an inheritance, but maketh us meet to be partakers of that inheritance. Our adopting Father ſtampeth his own Image
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168769:88"/> upon every adopted ſon. He maketh every believer <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare,</hi> to imitate his Father which is in heaven, which the other cannot do.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In Civill Adoption, the Adopted ſon cannot <note place="margin">4. The Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Inheritance both at once.</note> enjoy his father and the inheritance both at once; till the adopting father be dead, what is left him by the Adoptor doth not come into his hands. But now, herein lyeth another excellency of this Spirituall Adoption, Every believer may at once enjoy both the Inheritance and the Father, becauſe he that adopteth him liveth for ever; yea, becauſe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his Inheritance. So the truth ſtandeth. He that adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us to an Inheritance, Himſelf is that Inheritance which he adopteth us to; for we are adopted to the fruition of our God. Pſal. 16. 5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> So that here is Father and Inheritance joyned both together, becauſe the Father is the Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In Civill Adoption, it is but ſome petty Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances <note place="margin">5. They are poor petty things that we are here adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to.</note> which men are adopted to, by their adopting fathers, ſome poor things; it may be, a Farm, or Lordſhip, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; What if it be a Kingdom? It is, in compariſon, but a poor thing, to that Inheritance which Chriſt hath adopted us to, which we ſhall find deſcribed to the life, 1 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>To an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you.</hi> Here are the ſuper-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent properties of that Inheritance, the conſideration of which, will exceedingly inhaunce this priviledge of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>an incorruptible inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. An incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</note> Whatſoever Inheritances we have here below, they are liable to corruption. If a man's eſtate lie in Mony, that may ruſt, or the thieves may break through and ſteal it; If in Cattle, they may die; if in Houſes, they may be burnt; if in Lands, an enemy may invade them. But here is an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance that cannot be corrupted, becauſe it lyeth in God: For the Father is our Inheritance, and the immortall God is not lyable to any corruption.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>Inheritance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. An Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</note> There are few inheritances here below, but ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement ſticketh to them; they are either ill got, or ill
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:168769:88"/> kept. An Inheritance may be got by oppreſſion; or, if not ſo, yet there may be defilement in the keeping of it. He that commeth to inherit it may behave himſelf oppreſſively. If, when riches encreaſe, the heart commeth to be ſet upon them, there will be defilement with the inheritance. But here is an Inheritance undefiled. <hi>No unclean thing ſhall enter into heaven,</hi> not ſo much as a Serpent, to tempt in that Paradiſe that is above. <hi>Mahomet</hi> telleth his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a defiled inheritance, wherein there ſhall be a great deal of filthineſs: But Chriſt hath provided another kind of <hi>Inheritance</hi> for his, which is without ſin, <hi>undefiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>Inheritance that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. An Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>fadeth not away;</hi> a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken from flowers: The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a flower, and the ſweetneſſe of it, is quickly gone, withereth in a moment, and fit for nothing then but to be caſt away. So it is with all other temporall Inheritances, they loſe their glory after a while; they ceaſe to miniſter that content, which a man hoped to have found in them, which may be had at the firſt poſſeſſing of them; yea, all the glory of the world is like the flower of the field, that fadeth away. But herein lyeth the excellency of this Inheritance, <hi>it fadeth not away.</hi> It is a flower that never withereth, their joyes are alwaies flouriſhing: a continuall ſpring of flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing conſolations, ariſeth from the enjoyment of God, and every day ſweeter and ſweeter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>inheritance</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. An Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance reſerved</note> 
                  <hi>reſerved.</hi> We cannot ſay ſo of temporall inheritances, they may be gone. A trick at Law may put a man out of his eſtate, he may be wrangled out of it by ſome device or other, an enemy may come and ſpoile him of it, he can have no aſſurance. Though men purchaſe houſes and lands, for themſelves and their heirs for ever; alas, how ſoon are ſome men dead and gone? and, it may be, the next generation knoweth no ſuch houſes or lands, nor no ſuch men. But here is an inheritance reſerved: All the Devills in hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrangle a man out of This Poſſeſſion reſerved.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>inheritancc re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. An Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance reſerved in Heaven.</note> 
                  <hi>in heaven;</hi> which is ſtill a farther addition. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in Heaven, is excellent. Many fading things are on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:168769:89"/> earth. The leaſt thing in heaven is above the beſt things in the world. And it is a conſideration that addeth much to the ſweetneſſe of the Inheritance, to conſider where it lyeth: As, Who would not rather deſire to have a ſmall competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of land in <hi>England,</hi> amongſt his own <hi>friends,</hi> where he was born, than to have much in the <hi>Indies,</hi> amongſt <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi> It is an Inheritance reſerved in heaven, which is our Country, the Believer's home; <hi>Every man is born from above,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; his kindred live in Heaven, his Father is there, and his Mother there. We are ſtrangers upon earth, therefore our inheritance is in heaven, which is much more worth than our inheritance below. So excellent is this Inheritance. Therefore how great is this love of Chriſt, in giving us this priviledge, <hi>to become the ſons of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us learn from hence to judge of our <note place="margin">How to know, whether we be the ſons of God.</note> eſtates, how things ſtand between God and us, whether we be ſons and daughters, yea or no; nothing concerneth us more. Therefore time ſpent in this ſcrutiny will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Our Sonſhip is evidenced two waies.

By the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit.</note> ſelves to be ſons and daughters, by the witneſſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which ye read of, Rom. 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe to our ſpirits, that we are the children of God.</hi> This Spirit it is, that keepeth the Records of Heaven. The holy Ghoſt is conſcious to all the ſecrets of God, knoweth what names are written in the book of life; therefore he is able to make them known to us. None but the <hi>Son of God</hi> can Redeem, and none but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> can Aſſure, ſo as to make your Evidences clear, and infallible, and above all doubt and fear. But this doth not now lie ſo clear in my way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is therefore evidenced by way of <hi>Inference,</hi> Verſ. 8, 9. Our Sonſhip dependeth upon our receiving <note place="margin">2. By way of Inference.</note> Chriſt. It may be inferred from hence, <hi>As many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God.</hi> Therefore every ſon of God hath received him; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168769:89"/> every one that hath received him, may know himſelf to be the Son of God. This I ſhall inſiſt upon, hoping you will excuſe me, though I be a little large in it. To help you in your ſearch, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, what it is to receive <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> aright, becauſe your ſonſhip hangeth upon the having, or not having, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

I ſpeak not, what the work of God hath in the ſouls of Infants, when he conveyeth Chriſt to them; but in an ordinary courſe, when men and women come to years, there are certain precedent apprehenſions of the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Concerning the Perſon and Office of Jeſus Chriſt. <note place="margin">1. The Perſon and Office of Chriſt is to be underſtood.</note> No man receiveth he knoweth not what. We receive not Chriſt till we deſire him, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido;</hi> and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him not, till we know him. The ſoul firſt cometh, by the Spirit of Chriſt, to have ſome apprehenſions wrought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Perſon of Chriſt; to know him as <hi>God-Man, the Word made fleſh.</hi> The Man-God, onely Suffering as Man, Satisfying as God. There lyeth much in this, in the right apprehenſion of Chriſt's Perſon, which is the object of our faith, as it juſtifyeth. As they ſay of marriage-contracts, If there be a miſtake of the perſon, the Contract is not valid; as, if by ſome way of deceit, when the Contract com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168769:90"/> to be made up, another woman be brought in the habit and room of that party, to whom the man intendeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract himſelfe, here is an errour of perſon. As it was with <hi>Laban,</hi> that gave, to <hi>Jacob, Leah</hi> under colour of <hi>Rachell,</hi> and that made void the marriage. How can a ſoul be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Chriſt, and miſtake the perſon? and not know what Chriſt is, nor acknowledge his Godhead? Here is an errour of the perſon. Chriſt is another kind of perſon, than they take him for. As there muſt be knowledge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, ſo of his office too.</p>
               <p>We muſt know him as the great Prieſt, our ſacrifice. No other ſacrifice would have ſerved our turn, and none could have offered that ſacrifice but himſelfe. <hi>The Eternall ſpirit offered himſelfe without ſpot to God.</hi>

               <p>Theſe are the two great parts of his Prieſtly office.</p>
               <p>And ſo know him as our Prophet, guiding us by the Word. <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him,</hi> guiding us by his ſpirit, <hi>We ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> And as King, ruling us, and ſubduing our Enemies under his feet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſuppoſeth due apprehenſions about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">2. It ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin.</note> and danger of ſin. For till men have ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about this, they do not uſe to look out for a <hi>Saviour.</hi> Therefore the firſt thing the ſpirit of God doth, when he cometh to convert, is to convince, <hi>He ſhall convince the World of ſin, becauſe they believed not on me.</hi> To let men ſee ſin, as for its nature extreamly odious. That there are two great evils in it, <hi>Averſion fron God, and Converſion to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sin defined.</note> 
                  <hi>the Creature,</hi> Jer. 2. 13. <hi>Ye have committed two great evils; by forſaking Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewing to your ſelves Ciſterns, yea broken Ciſterns, that will hold no water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the danger of it; It is ſuch as expoſeth men to eternall death. And till this be ſeen, there will be no <note place="margin">3. It ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout rhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> looking out for Remedy; <hi>where Juſtice is, wages muſt be paid.</hi> Now God is juſt, therefore ſin is dangerous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſuppoſeth due apprehenſions about the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168769:90"/> of a Saviour, which followeth upon the ſight of ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. The convinced Gaoler cryed out, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Till men come to be ſenſible of their ſpirituall drought, they never look out for the waters of life. It is not every cut-finger that cauſeth a man to ſend to the <hi>Chirurgion;</hi> nor every head-ache, that maketh him to go to the <hi>Phyſitian:</hi> but when he is wounded, when he is ſick to death, then ſend for the <hi>Chirurgion,</hi> for the <hi>Phyſitian;</hi> when ſin lieth heavy upon the ſoul, then they make out for Chriſt. Thoſe that ſcoffed at <hi>Noah,</hi> all the while he was building the Ark, when the Deluge was come indeed, when they ſaw no other ſhift; then they cried out, <hi>A World for an Ark.</hi> When we are ready to be turned over the <hi>Ladder,</hi> pardon then, is pardon indeed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It ſuppoſeth ſome due apprehenſions about <note place="margin">4. It ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any thing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but by Chriſt.</note> the utter impoſſibility of obtaining ſalvation by any thing, or by any perſon, but by <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone. That which <hi>Peter</hi> taught, Acts 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven, given amongſt men, by which we muſt be ſaved.</hi> If there were another way open for ſalvation, then there were no ſuch neceſſity of receiving Chriſt; but ſeeing this is not onely a way, but the onely way of Gods appointment: ſeeing, as <hi>Naomi</hi> once ſaid to her daughters in Law, when they would needs follow her. Why, ſaith ſhe, Ruth. 1. 11. <hi>Have I any more ſons in my Womb, that they may be your Husbands?</hi> So, Hath God any more ſons in the Womb of his Eternall decree, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, that they may be <hi>Mediators</hi> for us; Seeing there is no Saviour, but He, therefore there is an utter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of obtaining ſalvation by any other perſon, or thing beſides. When the ſoul cometh to ſee this, it maketh way for the receiving of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As for all the Creatures, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man can by any means redeem the ſoul of his brother from death, he muſt let that alone for ever.</hi> There is no man, or means, or ordinances, but all ſay of ſalvation, as <hi>Job</hi> bringeth them in, ſpeaking of wiſdome, Job 28. 13, 14, 15. <hi>Where ſhall wiſdome be found? where is the place of underſtanding? Men know not the price thereof, nor is it found in the Land of the living. The deep</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:168769:91"/> 
                  <hi>ſaith, It is not in me, and the ſea ſaith, It is not with me; It cannot be got for Gold, neither ſhall Silver be weighed for the price thereof.</hi> So may I ſay of <hi>Salvation,</hi> Who knoweth the price thereof? where ſhall ſalvation be found? where is the place of happineſſe? The Law ſaith, It is not in me. Duties ſay, It is not in us. Ordinances ſay, We cannot give it. Why? It muſt come only from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore the ſpirit of God uſually letteth ſouls ſee an utter impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalvation, by any other, than by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It ſuppoſeth after all this, a due apprehenſion <note place="margin">5. It ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth pardon in and through Chriſt.</note> of a probability of obtaining pardon, and grace, in and through Chriſt. And this ſetteth the ſoul a moving towards him, and is an inducement, as to the humble ſoul, Lament. 3. 29. <hi>To lay its mouth in the duſt; if ſo be, there may be hope.</hi> As to thoſe Mourners in <hi>Joel,</hi> Joel. 2. 14. <hi>Who knoweth, if God will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</hi> Here is indeavour ariſing from probability. So the Ninevites in the propheſie of <hi>Jonah,</hi> Jonah 3. 9. <hi>Who can tell if God will turn, and repent of his fierce wrath, that we periſh not?</hi> Faith putteth it to the venture, and putteth it ſelfe upon the free grace of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <note place="margin">Four grounds of probability to obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</note> mercy; as having a probability, founded upon theſe four grounds of obtaining pardon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Upon the abundant goodneſſe of God,</hi> of which you <note place="margin">1. The aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant goodneſs of God.</note> read, Pſal. 130. 7. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord:</hi> Why? <hi>for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi> There is abundant mercy, and plenteous redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, therefore <hi>Iſrael</hi> may hope. This appeareth to be the mercy of an Infinite God, therefore he can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and take away the ſins of a finite Creature; here is one ground.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Probability of ſucceſſe: It is founded upon <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>powerfull Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Hebr. 7. 25. <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, thoſe that come to God by Him, ſeeing he ever liveth, to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> His blood like a mighty Ocean, is able to overflow, as it were, the mighty Rocks, as well as the loweſt Sand. The Sun of Righteouſneſſe is able to ſcatter the thickeſt Clouds, as well as the ſlendereſt miſts.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:168769:91"/>
               <p> Thirdly, <hi>Upon the free and gratious breathings of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. The free breatheings of the holy Ghoſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Joh. 3. 8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, thou heareſt the ſound thereof, and knoweſt not whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth.</hi> So it is with the <hi>Spirit.</hi> It hath breathed in others, and may breathe in thee, when it pleaſeth him. And therefore the ſoul reſolveth hopefully to wait on God, till the Spirit ſhall be pleaſed to breathe upon him; and to that end, it ſeeketh him in all the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is wont to breathe; becauſe the ſoul knoweth, it is juſt that the Spirit of God ſhould not breathe in any, if he be not ſought in all. If they neglect ſome one means, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Grace may be with-held. If any one of the Pipes be cut, the water cometh not home to the Ciſtern. And God is wont to convey grace to us, by ſo many Ordinances, as by ſo many Pipes; if one Ordinance be neglected, it is juſt with God to withdraw his grace. If a ſoul will hear, but not pray; if he neglecteth any one Ordinance, God may refuſe to breathe. Therefore the ſoul groundeth probability upon the free breathings of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Upon the example of many that have been</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Upon the example of many conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</note> 
                  <hi>converted before.</hi> It ſeeth the example of the periſhing of a multitude of ſinners, in the ſtory of the <hi>Ninivites;</hi> and of a multitude of ſins, in the ſtory of <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> and knoweth the ſtory of mercy, <hi>Such were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, and cleanſed, and ſanctified, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Spirit of God.</hi> Theſe are the apprehenſions which our Saviour Chriſt ſuppoſeth. All theſe, more or leſſe, in an ordinary courſe, taken with limitation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There are certain acts of the Will,</hi> which the <note place="margin">2. It ſuppoſeth ſeverall Acts of the Will.</note> receiving of grace includeth, which are ſpecially theſe two: Firſt, a preſent chuſing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> upon Conjugall tearms. Secondly, a truſting on him for ever after.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Receiving of Chriſt includeth in it a preſent chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Receiving Chriſt, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him for our Husband.</note> 
                  <hi>of Chriſt for our Husband, upon Conjugall tearms.</hi> I take that <hi>Metaphor,</hi> as moſt eaſie to expreſſe it by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is received under many notions, and under this amongſt others. As a Wife receiveth the Man in marriage, ſo the Soul receiveth Chriſt. It is a Choice, and preſent Choice, and a preſent Choice upon Conjugall tearms. This
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168769:92"/> is an act of the <hi>Will;</hi> Chuſing belongeth to the <hi>Will.</hi> When the <hi>Will</hi> is enabled by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to chooſe him for his <hi>All in all,</hi> and to make a preſent choice of him; they are tearms, not of the Future, but of the Preſent Tenſe, that make a Marriage. It is not, I promiſe to make thee my Wife in time to come, that maketh a Contract; but, I do take thee to my Wife, this is to make a Marriage. It is not to take Chriſt when I am rich, or older; but it muſt be a preſent chuſing of him, that maketh the Match: And it muſt be upon honourable tearms, ſuch as a woman taketh the husband upon, ſo as to forſake father and mother, and cleave to the husband. Chriſt did ſo for us, and we muſt do ſo for Chriſt. Chriſt forſook his Father, in ſome ſenſe, and came and emptied himſelf; forſook Heaven, and came down to us. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us,</hi> that ſo he might be wedded to his Church upon earth. There is ſomething like that, we have to do for Chriſt; the Soul muſt forſake all for Chriſt. As it is ſaid of the Spouſe, Pſal. 45. 10. <hi>Hearken, O daughter, and conſider, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline thine ear; forget alſo thine own people, and thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. So ſhall the King deſire thy beauty.</hi> There muſt be a forſaking of our former luſts, and former waies, and former careleſneſſe; a leaving of all to cleave to Chriſt. That you may underſtand it better, allude to that of Hoſ. 14. 3. <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, we will not ride upon horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the works of our hands, Ye are our gods. For in thee the fatherleſſe findeth mercy. Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more with Idolls?</hi> So, when the Soul cometh to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt, The Law ſhall not ſave us, we will not reſt upon our own <hi>Duties,</hi> our ſervices ſhall not be our <hi>Saviours,</hi> the means of grace ſhall not be our <hi>Mediators:</hi> What have we to do any more with <hi>Idells?</hi> and the luſts of our former ignorance, and intemperancy, and wantonneſſe, &amp;c? Here a chooſing of Chriſt ſuppoſeth a ſeparation from all things elſe, and a cleaving to him: <hi>Being joyned to the Lord, we are one ſpirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle's phraſe is; cleaving to him, ſo as to be ſubject to him, that is, on conjugall tearms, on which Chriſt is to be received. Epheſ. 4. 24. <hi>Therefore as</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:168769:92"/> 
                  <hi>the Church is ſubject to Chriſt, ſo let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</hi> We ſhould chooſe his Yoke as well as his Crown; his Spirit to guide us, as well as his Blood to redeem us; to be ſubject to him, as well as to be protected by him. This is the firſt thing included in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, namely, a preſent chooſing of Chriſt upon Conjugall tearms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Truſt in him for ever after, as our <hi>God;</hi> ſo ſaith <note place="margin">2. To truſt in him for ever after, as our God.</note> the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to truſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Continue to believe in his name;</hi> becauſe every one that hath received him, continueth to believe, continueth to truſt, and to rely upon him, and ſtay himſelf upon his God, and to lean upon his Beloved, as the phraſe is in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> As a woman that hath got an husband, hath one to truſt to for proviſion, and direction, and protection. If <hi>David</hi>'s wives be taken away, he will reſcue them; if <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his wife be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Haman</hi>'s plots, her husband will relieve her. The Soul, before marriage to Chriſt, was liable to all old debts, the Law had a ſaying to her, the Devill had a plea againſt her; but now ſhe is married, all is laid upon Chriſt. No acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies againſt the wife. Now the ſoul hath an husband, and accordingly ſhe truſts in Chriſt, and ſendeth the Devill to <hi>Chriſt her Husband</hi> for an anſwer. Thus you ſee what it Suppoſeth and Includeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, See what it Produceth, namely, Certain Effects, <note place="margin">3. It ſuppoſeth certain Effects, to witneſſe the truth of the former Acts. 1. Receiving Chriſt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Love.</note> that bear witneſſe to the truth of the former Acts, to make it appear, there were true Apprehenſions in the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and true Acts in the Will; and they are diverſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The true receiving of Chriſt, whereſoever it is, <hi>it produceth a Prizing Love,</hi> in the firſt place. It is impoſſible, but that the ſoul which hath received Chriſt indeed, ſhould prize him and love him, becauſe of the beauty and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him, 1 Joh. 4. 16. compared with verſ. 19. <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath given to us.</hi> Then followeth, <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Where there is a knowing and believing of God's love to us, there will be a reciprocall love from us to God. <hi>To him that believeth in Chriſt, Chriſt is pretious.</hi> It is not onely a love, but a priſing love. 1 Pet. 2. 7. <hi>To you therefore which</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:168769:93"/> 
                  <hi>believe, he is pretious.</hi> They that have received Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, will ſet a price upon him, howſoever others value him. <hi>Judas,</hi> though he did converſe with him, not having received him by faith, What a price ſetteth he upon him? the price of a <hi>Slave,</hi> thirty pieces of ſilver, the very price that was to be given by a man, that had bought a ſlave to be his ſervant: a goodly price. The <hi>Jews</hi> that bought him, and <hi>Judas</hi> that ſold him, make no more of Chriſt but thus. Now take the Soul, which hath indeed received him, and knoweth what is in him; ſuch a ſoul will not ſet Chriſt to ſale, no, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any tearms. Offer her Preferments, Eſtates, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Worlds; A goodly price for Chriſt, the ſoul will ſay! No, he is infinitely more worth then all theſe. <hi>To you that believe, Chriſt is pretious,</hi> becauſe ye have received him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It produceth a watchfull Fear.</hi> Whenſoever <note place="margin">2. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fear.</note> the ſoul receiveth Chriſt, it will be afraid to loſe him. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received a Kingdom that cannot be moved,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 12. ult. <hi>let us have grace to ſerve God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, with reverence and godly fear.</hi> One would think, all fear were now over. No, fear ſo much the more. The <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> that is the Kingdom of Heaven, which is often ſo called in Scripture; and it is <hi>a Kingdom that cannot be moved.</hi> The <hi>Law,</hi> that was taken away; but the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> that cannot be moved, no alteration of that: We muſt never look for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than what is evidently laid down in Scripture. A man that hath received this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> hath received <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in it. For this <hi>Manna</hi> commeth down in the dew of heaven, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the miniſtry of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And having received this Kingdom, we ſhall not be moved. Having received <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, let us ſerve him with reverence and god'y fear,</hi> ſaith the Scripture. There will be a fear, where there hath been a receiving of <hi>Chriſt; Kiſſe the Son. Serve him with fear, and rejoyce with trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. 11, 12. I will allude to <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 11. ye read there in the foregoing Verſe, of a Creeple, that was healed by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, And immediately his feet and ankle bones received ſtrength, and he ſtood up and praiſed God.</hi> What doth the man mean now, to leave his leaping and skipping, and come and claſp
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:168769:93"/> about <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John?</hi> In all likelihood, becauſe he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, when they were gone, his lameneſſe would return again to him. Such a diſpoſition there is in every ſoul that receiveth Chriſt, it is ſenſible of its having received health, and ſtrength, and comfort from him: Now, leſt his former lameneſſe ſhould return, leſt the luſts of his former igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhould again prevail, and thoſe terrours of conſcience under which it lay, ſhould come again; the ſoul is deſirous to hold Chriſt ſo, as never to let him go. Not that a ſoul that hath once received Chriſt, can loſe him for ever; but becauſe, though it cannot wholly loſe his preſence, yet it may loſe a great deal of its comfortable communion, which it had with Chriſt, and God in him. Therefore there will be a watchfull fear, leſt we ſhould loſe thoſe ſweet embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we have had from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This receiving of Chriſt in truth, <hi>produceth a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpirituall life. He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 12. Men are now other kind of creatures than before, they have motion from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle then they had before. As, where there is life, the ſoul ſetteth the body a working. So, when the ſoul hath Chriſt, it receiveth life, and motion, and appetite, and ſenſe, and grouth from him. This, true receiving of Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As there is a priſing Love, a watchfull Fear, and <note place="margin">4. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth fruit to God.</note> a Spirituall life; ſo, <hi>It produceth fruit to God.</hi> Every ſoul that hath received Chriſt, is more or leſſe a fruitfull ſoul; and doth not render fruit to it ſelf as formerly, but to God, aiming at him and his glory in what it doth. And this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon the former. I told you, It was receiving of Chriſt upon Conjugall tearms, as a woman receiveth an husband. And this you muſt know, that Chriſt hath alwaies iſſue by his wives; <hi>The Lord Jeſus hath no barren Spouſe.</hi> Every one that receiveth Chriſt for an husband, he hath iſſue by her; that ſoul <hi>bringeth forth fruit to God,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s phraſe is; and it followeth upon the marriage, in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Rom. 7. 4. <hi>Wherefore ye alſo are become dead to the Law in the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another;</hi> to God, in that marriage.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:168769:94"/>
               <p> Again, <hi>It produceth ſociety with Chriſt, Conjugall ſociety,</hi> when he hath been received upon Conjugall terms. <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſociety with Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>dwell with your Wives,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. Chriſt dwelleth with ſuch a ſoul, ſuch a ſoul converſeth with Chriſt. As it is ſaid of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 26. 8. <hi>Abimeleck King of the Philiſtins looked out at a window, and ſaw, and behold Iſaac was ſporting with Rebecca his Wife. And he concluded from thence that ſhe was his wife, becauſe he ſaw her ſporting with him, in private.</hi> The ſoul that hath truly received Chriſt, will ſolace it ſelfe with Chriſt in private; not onely injoy him in publick Ordinances in the ſight of the World, but in private Communion with him, even in the private duties of his worſhip. <hi>There will be a ſociety with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>There will be an expectation producing all good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">6. It produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good, in, through, and from him.</note> 
                  <hi>things in him, and through him, and from him. For he that hath not ſpared his own Son, but gave him to death for us all, how ſhall he not, together with him, give us all good things?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. He that hath Chriſt, hath got the Fountain, His blood is a fountain opened, in <hi>Zachary.</hi> He that hath the fountain, may have what water he ſtandeth in need of; be it more, or be it leſſe, be it a diſh full, or a paile full, or a Ciſtern-full: as long as he hath the fountain, he may have what he wanteth. So it fareth with the ſoul that hath Chriſt, the ſoul expecteth all things from him, for this, and a better life, onely with this caution; That ſhe muſt make account to him. <hi>Expectation implieth a waiting that foll weth upon beliefe,</hi> Iſai. 28. 16. <hi>Behold, ſaith the Lord,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Expectation defined.</note> 
                  <hi>I lay in Sion a corner ſtone, a pretious ſtone, a ſure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he that believeth ſhall not make haſte;</hi> Chriſt now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received, is full of grace. In Him are all treaſures, both of wiſdome, and knowledge, and of grace, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; ſuppoſe ſome of theſe be not immediately commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, he that believeth maketh not haſte. It is in Him, in Chriſt, therefore I may be content to waite, I ſhall have it when he ſeeth his owne time; <hi>Waiting is a ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of believers; as believing is, of having received.</hi> As put caſe, a place is void at Court, and two men are ſuiters for it. One rideth, Day and Night, and tireth Horſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168769:94"/> after Horſe, and maketh more haſte than good ſpeed, for fear the place ſhould be gone. The other he taketh his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, goeth to the Court, but ſlowly, Why? becauſe he hath had the <hi>Prince's</hi> promiſe before, and he knoweth he hath ſuch, and ſuch friends at Court, that will put the <hi>King</hi> in mind of it; Which of theſe two hath the better hope? Not he that maketh the moſt haſte, but the other. He confideth, the place ſhall be his, becauſe he truſteth to the <hi>Prince's</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and relieth upon his friends at Court. I ſee at length, we have got to an end of this particular; I beſeech you, bring your ſouls to this touch-ſtone. Try your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have received Chriſt, or no, and whether ye be ſons, and daughters or no, by what ye receive of Chriſt. Suppoſe, we ſay. Haſt thou ever had any due, and ſerious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the perſon, and office of Jeſus Chriſt? Haſt thou been convinced of the nature and danger of ſin? and, upon ſuch conviction, made to ſee the neceſſity of a Saviour? The utter impoſſibility of obtaining ſalvation, by any thing, or perſon, but Chriſt alone? And haſt thou after this, ſeen a probability of having pardon and grace from Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the aboundant goodneſſe of God, the Father, and the powerfull mediation of God the Son, and the free and gratious breathings of God the Holy Ghoſt? Haſt thou now thrown thy ſelfe into the arms of Chriſt, or laid thy ſelfe at his feet, and ſayeſt, if <hi>I die, I will die there:</hi> as the poor Lepers ſaid, when they went to the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians. If we ſtay here, we muſt periſh; if we go thither, we can but periſh.</hi> Certainly, if we ſtay in this condition, we muſt be damned, we will put it to that, to go to Chriſt, he can but damne us. <hi>We have heard, that the Kings of Iſrael, are mercifull Kings,</hi> and therefore, <hi>Benhadad</hi> ſaith, <hi>we will put ropes about our necks, and go to him?</hi> Haſt thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that it is juſt with God to damne thee, and yet haſt hope in <hi>Iſrael's</hi> God? Haſt thou ſaid with <hi>Heſter, I reſolve to go to him, and lay hold upon the golden Scepter, and if I periſh, I periſh?</hi> Better periſh in a way of expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to do, as I do. Try it, by what this receiving of Chriſt includeth. Was there not a time, wherein thy Soul made choice of Chriſt for her Husband, with reſolution in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:168769:95"/> the attendance on Chriſt to forſake all, and cleave to him; and ſubject to him in all things? To receive Jeſus Chriſt, as Lord, not onely as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to deliver thee from the wrath to come, but as Lord, to be ruled and governed by him? Haſt thou learned to truſt in him for the payment of all thy debts, and diſcharge of all thy ſins? to ſend <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> to Chriſt for an anſwer? Try, what this receiving of Chriſt is, by what it produceth. Where is thy prizing love to Chriſt? Is it more to thee, then thouſand worlds? where is thy watchfullneſſe? If thou haſt a Jewell about thee, thou wilt take heed, what Company thou comeſt into. A man that hath treaſure about him, will be more carefull to avoid the ſociety of <hi>Robbers,</hi> then ſuch as have no money in their purſes; If thou haſt received Chriſt, thou haſt a Treaſure. Oh take heed of coming into ſuch company, as may occaſion the with-drawing of Chriſt from thee. Where is thy ſpirituall life, if thou haſt received him? Doſt thou grow, as living things do? Haſt thou an Appetite to the word? Doſt thou deſire the ſincere milk of the Word? What fruit doeſt thou bring forth? Is it fruit to God? Hath Chriſt any Iſſue by thy ſoul? what ſociety haſt thou with Chriſt? Is there any ſolacing thy ſelfe in Meditation, and Prayer, and ſecret Communion between Chriſt, and thy ſoul? And then, doeſt thou expect all things from him? And canſt thou wait till God's time cometh, to make good all his promiſes, which are all yea, and amen, in Chriſt? I ſhall leave theſe things with you, Conſider them, And the Lord give you underſtanding in all things.</p>
               <p>Let us now go on to a further uſe of <hi>Conſolation</hi> from <note place="margin">Uſe of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> hence, and after that, to the next verſe. As there were no going to ſea for any man with Comfort, if there were not ſome Havens, and Harbours to ſtrike into, in a ſtorm; ſo no living in the World, if there were not ſome comfort to be fetched from Heaven. Look through all the Scriptures, and ye will hardly find a ſafer harbour than this, <hi>The relation between God, and believers.</hi> He is their <hi>Father,</hi> they his <hi>Children.</hi> They receive Chriſt, and ſo become ſons. This will afford comfort to us in ſeverall Caſes, which I ſhall briefly run over.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:168769:95"/>
               <p> Firſt, <hi>In caſe of weak abilities and performances,</hi> when they ſhall think that God is their Father, and therefore is <note place="margin">1. Receiving Chriſt afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth comfort in caſe of weak Performances.</note> willing to bear with them, though their performances be but weak, and their abilities ſmall; according to that, Pſal. 102. 13, 14. <hi>Like as a father pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are but duſt.</hi> God conſider; what mould we are made of, that we are <hi>Men,</hi> and not <hi>Angels; ſinfull men,</hi> and not men in a ſtate of <hi>Perfection.</hi> Therefore when we follow on to know him, and go lamenting after the Lord, as it is ſaid of the men of <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> 9. though God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a great deal of <hi>weakneſſe</hi> in our ſervices, yet we find a great deal of <hi>acceptance</hi> in him, when he looketh upon us as children. The truth is, though our faith be weak, our God is ſtrong; and from thence commeth our ſafety. As, when a father carrieth his little child in his armes, the Infant, with his little feeble arms, layeth hold upon the father; but the ſafety lyeth in the father's holding him, and not in his claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the father. So, we hold Chriſt by the feeble arm of our faith, but Chriſt holdeth us more ſtrongly by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and our ſafety commeth from thence. It is true, our faith is weak, and ſo our ſervices are accordingly weak; but ſtill look at God as a <hi>Father.</hi> Suppoſe a man have a ſon in forraign parts, ſent abroad for his education; before he hath well learned the Language, he writeth a Letter home to his father. He is but a ſcribler, what he writeth is written but in broken language, and badly writ. But it commeth from a child, and therefore the father taketh it well, and paſſeth by all the faults. The father biddeth the child ſhoot at ſuch a mark; the child draweth the bowe, and letteth go; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row falleth a great deal ſhort of the mark; yet he is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the father, becauſe he hath done his beſt. As men are in a condition of belief, ſo accordingly in a condition of <note place="margin">As our Faith is, ſo is our Comfort.</note> comfort. If I can but go to God as a Father, though with a great deal of infirmity, I may hope to find ſucceſſe. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> is often ſent away without a bleſſing; they cried, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and had no bleſſing. But, <hi>Father, Father,</hi> that alwaies proceedeth from the Spirit of <hi>Adoption,</hi> by which we cry <hi>Abba. Father;</hi> that is never ſent away
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168769:96"/> without an anſwer. <hi>Deus non negavit ſua petentibus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſweetly; God, that freely offereth himſelf to thoſe that ask not for him, will be ſure to give his good things to them that ask him, becauſe he is their <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, As in the firſt place; it miniſtreth comfort thus, <note place="margin">2. In caſe of ſinful failings.</note> in caſe of weak abilities and performances; ſo, <hi>In caſe of ſinful failings.</hi> We are not onely weaklings, but ſinners in what we do. But yet, Look at God as a <hi>Father,</hi> and conſider that, Mal. 3. 13. <hi>I will ſpare them, as a father ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> If we be <hi>ſons, ſerving-ſons,</hi> that go on to ſerve our <hi>Father,</hi> according to what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him; he will ſpare us, as a man ſpareth his ſon that ſerveth him. Doubtleſs, many are here, that know the bowells of parents; let thoſe that do not, conſider <hi>David</hi>'s carriage towards his ſinfull ſon <hi>Abſolom. Abſolom</hi> taketh up arms againſt his father, and endeavoureth to deprive him of his Eſtate, Crown, and Life. An Army commeth againſt him, and meſſengers come and tell <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Abſolom</hi> is overthrown. What enquiry doth <hi>David</hi> make? <hi>How fareth it with the Hoſt?</hi> No, but, <hi>Is the young man Abſolom well?</hi> And when a ſecond meſſenger came, and told him, <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> was ſlain, How do his bowells break out at his mouth! <hi>My ſon Abſolom, my ſon, would God I had died for thee.</hi> Let us judge, by this, how God looketh at a failing child, whoſe bowells are infinitely much more large, than thoſe of <hi>David</hi>'s. Ye know the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luk. 15. he had run a wild courſe; but reſolving with himſelf to take up, <hi>I will go to my father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſay unto him, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee.</hi> He doth ſo. And this word <hi>[Father]</hi> breaketh the heart of him, to whom he made his addreſſe, as ye know the ſtory, <hi>He fetched the robes, and the ring, and killed the fatted calf.</hi> Though a <hi>prodigall,</hi> yet a ſon ſtill. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> knew the comfort of this Relation, and therefore directeth us to make uſe of it in his Prayer, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven, for give us our treſpaſſes.</hi> That is a melting word, and therefore this muſt needs be a comfortable Relation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This affordeth Comfort to Believers, <hi>In caſe of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. In caſe of temporall ſufferings.</note> 
                  <hi>temporall ſufferings, and want, and loſſes, and dangers.</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:168769:96"/> Whatſoever our ſufferings be, they come from a Father. And the holy Ghoſt calleth upon us again and again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that, Deut. 8. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt a ſo conſider in thy heart, that as a man chaſtiſeth his ſon, ſo the Lord thy God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth thee.</hi> The father will call for a rod to correct his ſon, but will not turn him out of doors. Ye have it at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. from the 5th. verſe to the 11th. <hi>Ye have forgot the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which ſpeaketh to you as unto children, My ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chaſtiſeth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. For they verily for a few daies chaſtiſe us at their pleaſures, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of the holineſſe of God.</hi> All chaſtiſements tend, to make men partakers of the holineſſe of God. As for the wants of Believers, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be, here is comfort for them, they do not want a <hi>Father.</hi> It is the great conſolation that Chriſt gave to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> when he was to depart from them, in regard of his corporall preſence, Joh. 14. 18. <hi>I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, but I will come to you:</hi> That is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the word in the Original ſignifieth; I will not leave you <hi>orphans,</hi> or <hi>fatherleſſe.</hi> A child, though he be a ſon and heir, yet in his minority is often kept ſhort; a ſervant, haply, the ſteward of a family, hath as good allowance as he. The children of Chriſt here are in <hi>minority,</hi> therefore they are in ſome wants; but here is their comfort, <hi>they have an inheritance laid up for them,</hi> and that is a rich one. They are now in their <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> when they come to heaven, they ſhall have enough. In all dangers let it be conſidered, what care their <hi>Father</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for them, becauſe they are his children. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> An heir of a great family, what ſhall he need to fear, ſo long as he is converſing among his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſervants? All the creatures are ſuch to God; and thou being a child, thou art amongſt thy Father's ſervants, and therefore needeſt to fear no danger from them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>In caſe of ſpirituall faintings,</hi> and fears, and <note place="margin">4. In caſe of ſpirituall fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, fears, and deſertion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> deſertions. The ſoul of a believer ſometimes fainteth away for fear; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My heart and fleſh fail me.</hi> Here is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168769:97"/> now a ſwounding child, conſider what fathers are wont to do in ſuch caſes, how they ſend out for help preſently; all the houſe is little enough to look after a child in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. God himſelf pittieth his ſwounding children, and ſendeth his Miniſters, yea, his own Spirit, to ſpeak comfort to ſuch, and to adminiſter ſome <hi>Aquavitae</hi> to them, ſome water of life, that he may fetch them again out of their fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Sometimes fear poſſeſſeth a child of God, perhaps of falling into deſertion, as, it is poſſible, ſuch may befall the deareſt of God's Saints, as with <hi>Heman,</hi> who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>free amongſt the dead.</hi> God ſometimes doth this, but <note place="margin">ſal. 88. 5.</note> ſtill as a <hi>Father.</hi> As a father, that ſeeth his child ready to run into a river, or into the mire, he will take the child, and make him believe he will throw him in, but it is to make him fearfull of being thrown in. So, God makes his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren believe, that he will throw them into hell it ſelf; but it is for this very end and purpoſe, that they may never come there, for this fear will keep them from the waies of hell. Yea, ſometimes God is pleaſed to deſert his own children, <hi>Sion ſaith, My God hath forgotten me,</hi> as it is in <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> but then it is no more, but as when a father goeth behind a door, and ſuffereth his child to cry after him, and hideth himſelf on purpoſe to try the affections of the child, to make him the more eager in the purſuit of his father; which done, then he diſcovereth himſelf. Juſt ſo it is with God, He withdraweth the light of his countenance, not on purpoſe to keep it ſo for ever, but to make it more endeared to his children. As the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>In a little while I hid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 54. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy God, and thy Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Here is comfort in caſe of approaching death,</hi> a <note place="margin">5. In caſe of approaching death.</note> time when men ſtand much in need of comfort, when they are to leave all their outward comforts in this world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had need of better. Now if a man can ſay in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith, as Chriſt did, <hi>Father, I commend my ſpirit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>into thy hands;</hi> Here is an everlaſting conſolation, a Fort that all the devills in hell cannot batter. A man that in his life-time hath got acquaintance with God, may, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168769:97"/> commend his ſoul to God as to a <hi>Father,</hi> when he dieth. Other people may leave an eſtate behind them, and men may look after that. A man may commend his eſtate to his friend, and his body to the grave, and ſome may have ſo much charity as to interr that: But whom ſhall he commend his ſoul to? It is not for every man to think, to commend his ſpirit to God with confidence: Upon what acquaintance, will God ſay, can you do this? Will we truſt our Jewels to any, but our beſt friends? will we put them into the hands of thoſe, that we never ſaw in our lives? No. But a man that hath known God for his <hi>Father,</hi> he will with confidence ſay, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi> I do not onely lay my Jewell at thy feet, but put it into thy hands, that ſo it may be ſafe in thy cuſtody. I commend it into thy hands, out of which, all the devills in hell ſhall never be able to pull it. With this confidence, <hi>Paul</hi> believed. Happy is that ſoul that is able to ſay, as our Saviour did, before his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to his Diſciples, <hi>I go to my Father, and to your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> When a man is able to look his friends in the face, though with a dying look, and ſhall ſay, Be of good comfort, I ſhall be no loſer; <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father. Bleſſed are the people that are in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuch a caſe. Bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Bleſſed are the people that have received Jeſus Chriſt aright, and ſo are become ſons of Adoption. I have now done with that Point, and ſhall go on.</p>

Becauſe, the younger many times hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhare in ſpirituall things. Gen. 4. 4. Gen. 21. 14. Rom. 9. 13.</note> were, John 11. 10. <hi>Neither did his Brethren believe in Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall give you three Demonſtrations to make it appear That believers, as ſuch, are not born of blood.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe many good parents, have bad Children, as well as good ones. Adam</hi> had <hi>Cain,</hi> as well as <hi>Abel.</hi> And <hi>Abraham, Iſmael,</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And <hi>Iſaac, Eſau,</hi> as well as <hi>Jacob.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> had <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> as well as <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>It appeareth, becauſe ſometimes good parents have bad Children, and bad parents have good Children, in a line.</hi> Look into the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> ye ſhall find that bad <hi>Ahaz</hi> had good <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> good <hi>Hezechiah</hi> had wicked <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> ſo he was for a great part of his life. And wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> had good <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> had wicked <hi>Jehoaz.</hi> Good parents, bad Children, and bad Children, good parents.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It appeareth, <hi>becauſe the younger many times hath the greater ſhare in ſpirituall things,</hi> whereas, if grace were a naturall priviledge, the greateſt ſhare would go to them firſt. The firſt-born in all naturall priviledges, hath a double portion. But the Scriptures, and many times our own experiences will ſhew, that the <hi>firſt-born</hi> hath the leaſt ſhare here; therefore, this is not a naturall priviledge. God accepted <hi>Abel</hi> the younger, and not <hi>Cain. Iſaac</hi> findeth more acceptation then <hi>Iſmael.</hi> God loved <hi>Jacob</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and hated <hi>Eſau</hi> the elder, and ſo in many other inſtances. Grace doth not come by propagation, <hi>Believers are not born of blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, it may be objected, that Parents beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> after their own Image, It is ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 5. 3. <hi>He begot a ſon in his own Likeneſſe, after his own Image.</hi> Therefore it ſhould ſeem, that godly Parents muſt needs have godly Children; otherwiſe, how do they beget them, after their own Image?</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:168769:99"/>
               <p> The anſwer is eaſie. They beget Children, as men, not, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> as <hi>Saints.</hi> It is a certain Rule, <hi>Perſonalia non propagantur.</hi> Things that are perſonall, are not propagated. Now grace is a perſonall thing, not a naturall thing. A learned, and a godly man, begetteth a ſon, that is a man; but neither lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor godly, becauſe learning is an acquired habit, and godlineſſe is infuſed. And a man conveyeth what is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, not what is acquired. He that is begotten of him, is not a Scholler, much leſſe a Saint; becauſe holineſſe is ſupernaturall, beyond him. As it is with the Corn; it is threſhed, and ſevered from the Chaffe, before it is ſown, but then it bringeth forth the blade, and husk, and afterward the eare of Corn. The <hi>Circumciſed</hi> parent begetteth a Child, that is born <hi>uncircumciſed,</hi> becauſe his <hi>Circumciſion</hi> is not propagated. So it is here, a father that is free from the power of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and guilt of ſin, by the work of grace upon his heart; yet begetteth a Child, that is contrary to both theſe.</p>
               <p>How then is it ſaid, <hi>That if the Root be holy, the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <hi>are holy?</hi> That is a further Objection, that ye have, Rom. 11. 16. <hi>If the firſt-fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy.</hi> If the root be holy, ſo alſo is the branches?</p>
               <p>This is to be underſtood not of a perſonall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> which is an inherent quality; But of a federall holineſſe, which is of Relation, for that the root was holy. The Jewiſh parents were in the outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, being members of the viſible Church, therefore their Branches were partakers of a faederall holineſſe; but it doth not follow as to perſonall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. A man may at once be a child of wrath, in regard of the common condition of man in <hi>Adam;</hi> and yet be holy, in regard of the Covenant made in <hi>Abraham, That God would be his God, and the God of his ſeed.</hi> Well then, if it be thus, that believers, as ſuch, as are not born of blood; Let it ſerve to take men off, from their boaſting of their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> and <hi>Deſcent,</hi> of comming of this or that Family and Blood: It were worth the bragging of, if Grace came by <hi>Propagation.</hi> But ſeeing it doth not, <hi>Non ſanguine, ſed virtute nitamur,</hi> Let us not rely upon Blood, but upon Virtue, ſaith the <hi>Heathen.</hi> Let me ſay, Upon Chriſt, and,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:168769:99"/> in that ſenſe, upon Blood, There is one Blood we may rely upon, but it is the Blood of Chriſt, the Blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant; otherwiſe, there is no great difference in point of Blood, between men and men. Act. 17. 26. <hi>God hath made of one blood all nations of men, that dwell on all the face of the earth.</hi> All men out of one blood. The pooreſt <hi>Beggar</hi> commeth from <hi>Adam,</hi> who was Lord of all the world, as well as the greateſt <hi>Potentate</hi> upon earth; ſo as <note place="margin">No glorying in any blood, but the Blood of Chriſt.</note> there is no glorying in any blood, but in the Blood of Chriſt; he that hath a conſcience ſprinkled with that, he hath cauſe of glorying; <hi>He that glorieth, let him glory in this, that he knoweth me.</hi> Saith <hi>Prudentius, Sanguis Chriſti facit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eſſe nobilem;</hi> That which maketh a man noble; is, to have Chriſt's Blood in him, it is to be one of Chriſt's followers. It was that that ennobled the <hi>Beroeans,</hi> Act. 17. 11. <hi>Theſe</hi> (ſpeaking of the <hi>Beroeans) were more noble than thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily.</hi> The word in the Greek is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Theſe were better born than thoſe of Theſſalonica.</hi> He is well born that is new born. Here is a Blood to confide in. This is a Blood that cannot be tainted. The beſt blood may be tainted, Great men may become <hi>Traitors,</hi> and ſo taint their blood. Here is a Blood without poſſibility of tainture, that waſheth white whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it commeth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Believers, <hi>They are not born of the will of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. They are not born of the will of the fleſh.</note> 
                  <hi>fleſh.</hi> By the <hi>will of the fleſh,</hi> I underſtand, the will of a man in the ſtate of corruption, as long as he is nothing but fleſh; <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3. And then the meaning is, That no man can attain Grace, or the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, by the utmoſt improvement of his own <hi>free-will,</hi> while he is yet in the ſtate of corruption. No man, by the utmoſt improvement of nature, can raiſe himſelf to grace. No man, that is yet in the fleſh, by the improvement of the will of the fleſh, can become a ſpirituall man. No creature can raiſe it ſelf to an higher rank of creatures; a Stone cannot make it ſelf a Tree, to have <hi>grouth and life;</hi> nor can a Tree make it ſelfe a Beaſt, to have <hi>Senſe;</hi> nor can a Beaſt make it ſelf a Man, to have <hi>Reaſon;</hi> nor can a meer Rationall man
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:168769:100"/> make himſelf a <hi>Saint,</hi> by the improvement of his own Free-will, as the holy Ghoſt telleth us, Rom. 9. 16. <hi>So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Not of him that willeth, by <hi>deſiring;</hi> nor of him that runneth, by <hi>endeavouring;</hi> but of God that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy. <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 15.</note> He will have mercy on <hi>Sion,</hi> therefore he putteth forth grace to make it free, otherwiſe it would be in bondage for ever. This is the great queſtion between the <hi>Arminians,</hi> at this day, and us <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> of man doth never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grace by its own liberty, but the <hi>will</hi> of man attaineth liberty by grace. It is ſo far free, that the grace of God will make it free; otherwiſe, it hath no freedom at all to God, much leſſe is it free to raiſe it ſelf to a ſtate of grace. <hi>As we are not born of blood, ſo not of the will of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That man is not able to do any thing that is good, by the power of his own free-will, I ſhall demonſtrate it, by an <note place="margin">Man cannot do good by the power of his own free-will.</note> argument taken from the impotency of the will of the fleſh. The Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>While we are without Chriſt, we are without ſtrength,</hi> and ſo unable to do any ſpirituall good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> No ſupernaturall ſtrength in a naturall man. The will of the fleſh can but follow the guidance of the wiſdom of the fleſh; now, <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that is enmity againſt God.</hi> Therefore the will of the fleſh never riſeth to friendſhip with him. Rom. 8. 7, 8. <hi>Becauſe the carnall mind,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> So then, they that are in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God. This is a deep myſtery, this of the free-will of man: but I am not willing to wade into the depth of the Controverſie; onely I ſhall ſay ſomething by the way to you.</p>
               <p>Know therefore this, that at the firſt, the freedom of the <note place="margin">Freedome of of will, at firſt ſtood in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to good, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</note> will in intelligent creatures, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> ſtood in an Indifferency to good and evill; yet ſo, as look what way the will betaketh it ſelf, to that it ſhall be confined for time to come. If it chuſe good, it ſhall be permanent in chuſing good; if evill, it ſhall be able to chuſe nothing elſe.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:168769:100"/> The <hi>good Angels</hi> choſe that which was good, and the bent of their hearts will continue the right way; therefore now they are confirmed in goodneſſe, and are free to nothing elſe. The <hi>bad Angels,</hi> they choſe what was evill; therefore they are now left to the obduration of their own hearts, and can do nothing, nor will nothing, but what is evill. <hi>Man,</hi> who though made in an holy ſtate, yet was <hi>mutable;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a will ſubject to change, fell upon the worſt part, choſe evill, whereas he might have choſen good; and ever ſince, all his poſterity by nature are able to do nothing elſe. <hi>Radix peccati, libertas;</hi> this freedom of will was the very root, from whence the firſt ſin ſprung. Therefore, ever ſince the firſt fall, the <hi>will</hi> hath been deeper in evill than the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> is more a verſe from chuſing good, than the <hi>mind</hi> from defiring good; as <note n="*" place="margin">Medaea.</note> ſhe ſaid,<hi>—video meliora, probo<expan>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> Deteriora ſequor—</hi>Many things which our judgments are againſt, our affections are enclined to. So that now, no man hath farther freedom of <hi>will</hi> to do good, than his <hi>will</hi> is made free by grace; ſo much free-grace as is communicated, ſo much <hi>free-will</hi> a man hath, and not a whit more. The fleſh contributeth nothing to the free-will, to do good. <hi>Not of the will of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True indeed, in naturall things, as eating and drinking; <note place="margin">Freedome of will, in things Naturall and Civill, and Outward acts of Religion.</note> and civill things, as buying, and ſelling, and marrying, and giving in marriage; there is a freedom of will to do this or that. It is true alſo, that in the outward acts of Religion, the free-will of man, aſſiſted by common-grace, may chuſe what is good. A man may will to go to Church, rather than ſtay at home; and when he is there, he may liſten to what is ſaid, and meditate of what he hath heard; and when he is come home, repeat it. A great deal of uſe men may have of this freedom, as to the outward act of Religion. It is for want of improving that power, which God giveth to men in ſuch acts, that they periſh. But neither have men abilities, by the improvement of them, nor free-will, to do any of thoſe acts, (when a man, by nature, cannot turn himſelf to to any ſpirituall duty) in a ſpirituall way; That requireth an aſſiſtance of ſpeciall grace. Neither have they abilities to do thoſe more ſupernaturall acts, which immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:168769:101"/> ſalvation, in any meaſure, by the power of their own free-will; they cannot do any outward act of Religion well: The <hi>Bonum</hi> and <hi>Bene</hi> cannot be done, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace. As, Take an Hatchet that is ſharp; this, in the hand of a common man, will cut, becauſe it hath a capacity that way; but to make a Table, or Stool, or Statue, that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth <hi>influentiam Artificis;</hi> it is not a common hand that can do that, there muſt be the hand of an Artificer. So, though the <hi>free-will</hi> of man may do an outward act, in the worſhip of God; yet, to do this act well, requireth a further influence, than the common providence of God, aſſiſting all his creatures. So it will be found much more, if we come to thoſe acts upon which ſalvation dependeth. Turning to Chriſt, and believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and loving God for himſelf; theſe, the will of man improved, cannot riſe to. No man can repent, till he be turned, Jer. 39. 19. <hi>After that I was turned, I repented;</hi> firſt turned, and then repented; not, I turned my ſelf firſt, and repented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. As it was in the firſt Creation, ye know what is ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2. 23. <hi>The Lord God formed man of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrills the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul.</hi> Here is a <hi>duſt-heap,</hi> Can that become a man? No, unleſſe God breathe the breath of life. Here is an <hi>unregenerate</hi> man, Can that man become regenerate? No, unleſſe the ſame power goeth forth, to make a new creature here, that went forth in the firſt Creation. Epheſ. 2. 10. <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto good works.</hi> Creation was out of nothing, nothing in corrupt nature will ſerve for the new building. There are the faculties and ſubſtance of the ſoul, that God makes uſe <note place="margin">God makes uſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, not of the Qualities of the Soul.</note> of; but the qualities, not one of them will ſerve. <hi>Old things are done away, all things are become new,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. So as, when God createth grace in the ſoul, he doth ſomething anſwerable to what he did, when he breathed life into that duſt. Onely with this difference, God made <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt in his full ſtature, a perfect man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, when the new creature is framed, there muſt be a growing up to perfection. There is a perfection of parts indeed, in the firſt draught of the new creatures; not onely a new <hi>heart,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:168769:101"/> but a new <hi>tongue,</hi> a new <hi>hand,</hi> and a new <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> but there wanteth a perfection of degrees, which was in <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>growing up to a full ſtature.</hi> But as to the thing in hand; There is an utter inability in nature, to raiſe it ſelfe to grace, as in that duſt, to make it ſelfe a man.</p>

As I am loath to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, ſo, loath am I, to wave them altogether; Only, becauſe ſomething haply may not be fit for this Auditory, let us content our ſelves with this. That the ſame power, <note place="margin">The ſame power that made the Creature, muſt make the new-Creature.</note> which made man at firſt, a Creature, muſt go to make him a new-Creature. There is none of that power in corrupt nature; therefore, men may not be born of the will of the fleſh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. ſpeaking of a mighty power, working in them that believe. <hi>What is the exceeding greatneſſe of his power to us-ward, who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed Him from the dead.</hi> The ſame power that went to the Creation of man, the ſame power that went to the Reſurrection of Chriſt, muſt go to man's Converſion; Faith cannot be wrought without it. Therefore it is called the faith of the operation of God, Col. 2. 12. <hi>Ye are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen with Him, through the faith of the operation of God.</hi> Faith can neither be begotten, without much power, nor continued without much power, 1 Theſ. 1. 11. <hi>Fulfilling all the good pleaſure of his goodneſſe, and the work of faith with power.</hi> So then, not to intangle our ſelves in this Controverſie, let us make uſe of what hath been ſaid.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:168769:102"/> will, and liberty might make choice of Chriſt. Hence it is, that the proud Dutch man, when he was urged with that place of the Apoſtle; <hi>Who hath made thee to differ?</hi> dared to return this abominable ſpeech (for I can call it no other) Who hath made me to differ? Why, <hi>Ego feci meipſum.</hi> I have made my ſelfe to differ. God gave me <note place="margin">Blaſphemy.</note> a power to will, but my will determined it ſelf, to lay hold on Chriſt. Thus to teach, That God giveth a <hi>Poſſe velle,</hi> to have power to do good; but, when grace hath done all it can, a man is left to his own liberty, to chuſe, or refuſe; What is this, but to aſcribe ſalvation to our ſelves, more than to God.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>not of the will of man.</hi> As before, he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded our owne wills, from being able to bring us to grace; ſo here, he excludeth the will of others, be they never ſo eminent. <hi>Iſh</hi> is put for men of eminency, Gen. 45. 11. <hi>ſaith Jacob to his Children, Carry down the Man a preſent.</hi> That is, the <hi>Governour</hi> of the Land, <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But above all, an undeniable place is in the <hi>Prophe,</hi> where ye have both <hi>Iſh,</hi> and <hi>Adam.</hi> The mean man bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down, and the great man humbleth himſelfe. <hi>Adam</hi> is the mean Man. The great man, that is <hi>Iſh.</hi> So for <hi>Homo,</hi> and <hi>Vir.</hi> It is a known ſtory of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that went in the day time, with a Candle, and Lant-horn in the ſtreets, and being asked, Whither he went? ſaith he, I go to ſeek a <hi>Man.</hi> The reply was, There were enow in the Market place. Nay, ſaith he; I ſee many people, but I cannot find a Man amongſt them all. As in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we ſay, Such a one, ſheweth himſelfe a <hi>Man,</hi> that is, exceeding worthily. So then, <hi>we are not born of the will of men,</hi> that is, <hi>Men, how Eminent ſoever,</hi> be their fathers never ſo godly, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors never ſo able, or the Maſters of the family, never ſo Eminent. As our owne wills cannot bring us to grace, ſo the will of others cannot, how eminent ſoever they be. Men may wiſh us well, but they cannot convey grace to us. This I take to be the meaning of this phraſe, It is a truth, <hi>that no man is born of the will of men.</hi> We may pray for one another, and inſtruct one another, and ſpend many words, and tears, and prayers, for one another; and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring one another to grace for all this. Neither is it in vain, that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> inſerteth this Clauſe: Becauſe it is the common deceit of men; And all they have to ſhew for the hope of ſalvation, is, that they live in a good family, and have a godly Father, and a religious Mother, or a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtor, that taketh a great deal of pains amongſt them. <hi>Micah,</hi> what a glad man was he, though he had been a <hi>Thief,</hi> Judges 2. 17. <hi>For he had ſtollen eleven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhekles of Silver from his Mother,</hi> and he was an <hi>Idolater,</hi> Verſ. 5. <hi>For he worſhipped moulten gods:</hi> yet when he got a Miniſter to his mind, Certainly, ſaith he, <hi>now know I, that the Lord will do me good, ſeeing I have a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi>

Can ye be born of the will of your Miniſters, though they wiſh you never ſo well, and take never ſo much pains for you? No, you muſt ioyne your owne indeavours, with the Miniſter's labours, elſe they will be ineffectuall; yea, God himſelfe muſt joyne his bleſſing, both to your Indeavours, and our labours; elſe ye can never be born again.

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>All believers are born of God, and onely of God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. All belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are born of God.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:168769:104"/> All believers are new born; This we muſt clear to you. There is an inſeperable Connexion between faith, and the new birth. So it runneth in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>To them that believe in his Name, who were born of God.</hi> Faith, and the new Creature, are ſo inſeperable, that <hi>Paul</hi> putteth the one, for the other. If ye compare theſe two places in the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Gal. 5. 6. with Gal. 6. 15. <hi>In Jeſus Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumciſion nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but Faith which worketh by love.</hi> What is that? ſee the fifteenth Verſe of the ſixth Chapter, <hi>Neither Circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion, but a new Creature. New Creature,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is all one; where faith is, there is a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So then, <hi>All believers are new born, and new born of God;</hi> becauſe, as ye have heard already, (which will ſave me a labour to exemplifie this.) It requireth a Divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to beget a man to Chriſt, Jam. 1. 18. <hi>Of his owne will begot he us with the Word of Truth, Of his owne will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got he us.</hi> To make a man partaker of godlineſſe, there muſt go Divine power, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 2 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Divine power, He hath given us all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Life, and Godlineſſe;</hi> Such a power as went to the <note place="margin">Regeneration requireth a greater power then Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Creation, yea, a greater power then went to the Creation, if a greater can be. God putteth forth a further act of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Regeneration, then in Creating men, and the whole World at firſt; becauſe there was then nothing to reſiſt. <hi>God ſpake the Word,</hi> and there was no oppoſition made. <hi>Let there be light, and there was light, Let the waters be gathered together, and they were gathered together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Channell.</hi> But when God cometh here to Convert, all is up in arms, Corrupt nature ſtruggleth for it ſelfe, and the Devill, likely to be thrown out of his hold, maketh the beſt of it that he can, and muſters all his forces to maintain his poſſeſſion; here is required a greater power, becauſe of reſiſtance, which was not in the former work. Would not a man ſay, if he ſhould go into a <hi>Potters ſhop,</hi> or <hi>Glaſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> that a man might ſooner make a thouſand pots, or glaſſes, then when a pot or glaſſe is broken all to pieces, to make it whole again; That is a much greater work.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:168769:104"/> This is the caſe here: In the Creation, God brought all things out of nothing. Here is but one ſingle work. But when he comes now to regenerate, he findeth men's hearts broken to pieces, and he muſt make them ſound again. That is a further work, a double work. He muſt pull down the old building, and ſet up a new frame, none of the old, not a ſtick will ſerve. <hi>Old things are done away, all things are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cor. 2. 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>become new.</hi> Therefore it is, that all the works of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though an Almighty work, is but the finger as it were of God. <hi>When I conſider the Heavens, the work of thy fingers.</hi> The works of man's Redemption, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, require the whole arme. So ſpeaking of God, after the manner of men, for to him all things are alike eaſie, Luk. 1. 51. <hi>He hath ſhewed ſtrength with his arme,</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the work of our Redemption by Chriſt. <hi>Who hath believed our Report? To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> That which is manifeſt in the Goſpell, that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us of our Redemption, ſaying, <hi>It is the arm of God.</hi> At the firſt, it was but a word. <hi>Let there be light, and it was ſo.</hi> The work of our Redemption coſt not onely words, but tears, and ſweat, and blood, and the Life of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. <hi>God breathed the breath of Life into man,</hi> that he might revive him, and become a new Creature. So that this work conſidered, one cannot be born again of any, but of God.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the Application. If believers are born <label type="milestone">

They have received that from the hands of God, that the reſt of the World are ſtrangers to. They are better born then others; that is the word, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. We ſtand ingaged to the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> for this bleſſing. <hi>Behold what manner of love, the Father hath ſhewed unto us?</hi> We owe our new birth to God the <hi>Father.</hi> And to the <hi>Son</hi> too, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9. 6. The name of Chriſt is <hi>the Everlaſting Father.</hi> And, <hi>to God the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. <hi>Except we be born again of Water, and of the Spirit,</hi> born of the Spirit; To thend, we may be the more <note place="margin">3. Graces and priviledges that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new birth.</note> ſenſible of this ineſtimable bleſſing, conſider the graces and priviledges that accompany this new birth. I will name but three.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:168769:105"/>
               <p> Firſt, <hi>Is likeneſſe to God:</hi> We are ſo born of God, as to <note place="margin">1. Is likeneſſe to God:</note> bear his Image, to be righteous, as he is righteous, 1 Joh. 2. ult. <hi>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one which doth righteouſneſſe, is born of him.</hi> It is true of all the Creatures, <hi>They are made of God:</hi> But it is true onely of Saints, <hi>They are born of God.</hi> Therefore, though every Creature hath ſomething of God in him; yet a Saint hath more: All have the <hi>foot-ſteps</hi> of God, but Believers have his <hi>Image.</hi> They repreſent him, as a man's <hi>ſon</hi> repreſents his <hi>father.</hi> There may be the Image of a man taken in a <hi>Picture,</hi> that may ſhew ſomething of him; and his Image in a <hi>glaſſe,</hi> that ſheweth more, that repreſenteth his motion, which the other doth not; But his Image in his <hi>ſon,</hi> that is the moſt lively of all, that repreſenteth his diſpoſition. Such an Image of God is in every Saint, it repreſents the quality of God, and the diſpoſition of him. <hi>He is made partaker of the Divine nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>There is in him a love to God, and to the Saints,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Love to God, and to the Saints.</note> which is another adjunct of the new birth, of which, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7. compared with, 1 Joh. 5. 1. verſ. <hi>Beloved, Let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, is born of God, and knoweth God,</hi> Chap. 5. 1. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God, and every one that loveth him that begetteth, loveth him that is begotten of him.</hi> Firſt, here is love to God, the Common father of all the Saints. It is true in this Caſe, <hi>Amor deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, ſed non ſemper aſcendit.</hi> Love amongſt men deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, It goeth down from the Parent, to the Child; but it doth not alwayes aſcend from the Child, to the Parent. But here, as there is a love deſcending to us, ſo from us aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to God. As the <hi>Iron</hi> that is touched with the <hi>Load-ſtone,</hi> hath an inclination of following the <hi>Load-ſtone:</hi> So when God hath touched the ſoul with Love, it leaveth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct behind it, of following after God. As every one that is new born, hath a love to God, ſo hath he alſo to the Saints. <hi>He that loveth him that begetteth, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi> Look as it is in nature. Light ye know is the prime object of ſight. It is the principall viſible object, and the more of light in any thing, the more viſible that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:168769:105"/> thing is. So Chriſt is the principall object of a Chriſtians love; and the more of Chriſt is in any perſon, the more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Chriſt the principall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's love.</note> that perſon is, in a Chriſtian's eyes. The object that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt in the light, is moſt ſeen; and the Saint, that hath moſt of Chriſt in him, is moſt beloved by every one that is new-born, when they come to diſcern that amiableneſſe in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing that accompanieth this new-birth, is, <note place="margin">3. Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpirituall enemies.</note> 
                  <hi>Victory over ſpirituall enemies,</hi> which doth exceedingly raiſe the priviledge of being born of God. Victory over the world, and victory over the devill, ye have them both, 1 Joh. 5. 4. <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, overcommeth the world.</hi> It is true, Regenerate perſons may get many a blow and knock from the world, and many times be foiled too; and from the frowns and flatteries of the world, a Saint may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. As it is, when a thief ſetteth upon a man in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and aimeth at his purſe; he may ſtand in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and haply receive ſome wounds, or blowes; but yet, the thief is not able to take his purſe from him. Here a man commeth off a conquerour, though not without blows. So, <hi>Whatſoever is born of God, overcometh the world,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the iſſue, Grace getteth the upper-hand. <hi>Though he that is born of God may be conquered; yet, That which is born of God cannot be conquered.</hi> It is not, Whoſoever is born of God; but, <hi>Whatſoever is born of God.</hi> There is an <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in that. As a victory over the world attendeth this new-birth, ſo a victory over the devill too: 1 Joh. 5. 18. <hi>We know, that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not. But he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</hi> He ſinneth not, ſo as to be touched by that wicked one. Take them together, that is, He ſinneth not againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſinneth not, ſo as to be <hi>devilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> He that is once a child of God, never becomes a child of the devill. That is the meaning of that, <hi>That wicked one toucheth him not:</hi> Not, but that That wicked one, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, may annoy a Saint, and foil him many times; but not with that which the Schools call, <hi>Tactus qualificativus,</hi> ſuch a touch as altereth the nature of a thing. As for example, Men that ſpeak of the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> they ſuppoſe it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:168769:106"/> to have ſuch a property in it, as when it toucheth the metal, it turneth it into Gold. Such a property the Spirit of God hath upon the ſoul of man; when it toucheth the ſoul, it putteth a divine nature into it. Now, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, The wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> ſo as to alter him, and to turn him into his own nature, and make him as very a devill as himſelf; which they, that have ſinned againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> do. Becauſe, even as very a devill as Satan is, he that is once made partaker of the divine Nature, cannot be touched ſo, as to be made partaker of the diabolicall nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This may ſerve in the next place, <hi>To undeceive</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. To unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive carnall Profeſſors.</note> 
                  <hi>carnall Profeſſors,</hi> that ſtand ſo much upon their faith, and have no new birth to ſhew; that ſay, They have believed ever ſince they were born; when as indeed, no man can believe till he be born again. There is an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between theſe two, <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>New-creature;</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt John</hi> putteth them together, <hi>To thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his name, who are born of God.</hi> Whereſoever Chriſt is received by faith, there he doth renew the ſoul, as well as ſave it. He bringeth with him plaiſters, that do not onely hide ſin, but heal it; not onely cover it, but cure it. He bringeth with him not onely pardoning mercy, but purging mercy, and renewing grace. And therefore it is in vain for men to call themſelves believers, if they be not new-born. <note place="margin">The Pleas of carnall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. 1. They are baptized.</note> Some pleas indeed they have, which I will briefly anſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are baptized, and therefore born again; their baptiſm is the Laver of Regeneration. That is all ſome have to ſhew.</p>
               <p>Whether that place, Tit. 3. 5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of the new-birth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> be meant primitively of Baptiſm, yea or no, may be diſputed. But I wave that.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe that aſcribe moſt efficacy to Baptiſm, they ſay, That Infants Elect, and onely they, do in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <note place="margin">2. They onely that are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, receive Regeneration in Baptiſm.</note> receive a Regeneration. But what kind of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? whether <hi>Potential, Habitual,</hi> or <hi>Initial,</hi> they know not; not ſuch as will ſerve their turn, when they grow up to years; for then they muſt have an <hi>Actuall</hi> and farther Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, before they can be ſaved. <hi>Peter</hi> telleth us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:168769:106"/> that the outward waſhing with water ſaveth none, there muſt go a farther work to that, 1 Pet. 3. 21. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the baptiſm that now is, anſwering that figure, (which is not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Demanding, which a good conſcience maketh to God) ſaveth us alſo, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That, no man can have, that is not new born. There cannot be a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> till there be a <hi>ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt.</hi> For we are ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, Heb. 12. 24. Now a man that is new-born, when Satan put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in a Plea againſt him, he can put in his Anſwer againſt Satan's Bill; he is able to plead <hi>Sincerity,</hi> when he is accuſed of <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and to make an apology for himſelf, againſt the accuſations of the Law. If this ſatisfie not, conſider one or two places more, to ſhew the vanity of this plea, Gal. 6. 15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion; but a new creature.</hi> Baptiſm is, what Circumciſion was. Baptiſm availeth not, but a new <note place="margin">Baptiſm avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth:</note> creature. Baptiſm, without new-birth, can bring no man to ſalvation. One may be a kind of baptized <hi>Turk,</hi> as there were circumciſed <hi>Ellemits</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that is, Men cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in the fleſh, and yet <hi>Heathens</hi> in their diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Ezek. 18. 31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wherein ye have tranſgreſſed; and make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> They muſt die, unleſſe there were a new ſpirit, and a new heart within them: Nothing but death without the new creature, though an Iſraelite.</p>
               <p>When men are beaten from this, they fall to a ſecond <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Plea of carnall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</note> plea, and pretend to a <hi>New-birth;</hi> Why? Becauſe they are not ſo bad as they have been; ſome duties they neglected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now perform them; ſome errours they committed before, but now abſtain from them. Therefore ſurely they are born of God.</p>
               <p>To make Anſwer to this Plea, we muſt know, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">Their Plea anſwered.</note> this new-birth is, there is a farther thing then reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace; there is <hi>holineſſe of life:</hi> Epheſ. 4. 24. <hi>That ye put on that new man, which after God is created in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and true holineſſe.</hi> Now <hi>holineſſe</hi> goeth farther,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:168769:107"/> than to the abſtaining from ſome evill, and doing of ſome good. <hi>Holineſſe</hi> reacheth to the mortification of luſt; where there is a new man, created after <hi>holineſſe,</hi> luſt will be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, not onely to impriſonment, but to death. The Woolf is not onely tied up, but turned into a Lamb; the Sow is not onely put into a paſture, but changed into a Sheep. A woolf tyed up, doth not ſo much miſchief as before; a Sow in a paſture is not ſo ſwiniſh and filthy, as when it wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the mire: but their natures ſtill remain. So it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace, their natures are the ſame, if not ſome change in their converſation. Where the new-birth is, there is a change of the heart, and a new nature wrought; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men do duties with delight, and conſtantly. Men look at luſts now, not as <hi>David</hi> did at <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but as <hi>Joab</hi> did at <hi>Abſolom,</hi> that I may uſe that compariſon. <hi>Aſolom,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, ye know; <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> they both ſet themſelves againſt him; but ſo, as <hi>David,</hi> though he could not but be diſpleaſed with <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s rebellion, yet he carrieth affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards him, and deſireth, that the young man may be dealt gently withall. On the other ſide, <hi>Joab,</hi> when he getteth an opportunity, throweth dart upon dart, and never <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 14.</note> leaveth till he hath ſlain him. So, ye have many a man, that hath ſome work of grace upon his heart, that yet hath a months mind, and longing after ſin: he would have his ſin ſuppreſt, as <hi>David</hi> would have <hi>Abſolom,</hi> but yet <hi>Abſolom</hi> muſt live, though a rebellious ſon. Many would have ſin ſuppreſt, that it may not expoſe them to hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but all this while their ſins muſt live. But the new creature is carried out with hatred againſt ſin, therefore it is not content without its deſtruction. <hi>Mortifie your earthly members,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> Such a ſin, ſaith the regenerate ſoul, will have my death, therefore I will have its death; I will not be content till it be crucified with the luſts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof. I ſhall now proceed to the 14 Verſe.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are myſteries, by ſome more ſpoken of, and leſſe underſtood. Things that we cannot be ignorant of, without danger; nor diſcourſe of, without all Reverence. Things that no Eloquence of man can reach, no ſoul of man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the full latitude of them; Yet ſome thing we ſhall ſpeak hereof by God's aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Who is here meant by the <hi>Word?</hi> I anſwer, the <note place="margin">1. By the <hi>Word,</hi> is meant the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity.</note> ſecond perſon in the Trinity ſo called, in that known place, <hi>There are three that bear witneſſe in Heaven, the Father, and the Word, and the Spirit; and theſe three, are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 8. The ſame perſon that is called the <hi>word,</hi> in the beginning of this Chapter, is ſaid, <hi>to be with God.</hi> I ſhall not ſpeak of that, becauſe heretofore I have been large in it, but come to the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is here meant by <hi>Fleſh?</hi> Fleſh ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <note place="margin">2. By <hi>Fleſh,</hi> is meant the whole man.</note> the whole man in diverſe places of Scripture. Man ye know conſiſteth of two parts, which are ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and ſometimes called <hi>ſoul,</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> Now by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> either of theſe parts may be put
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168769:108"/> for the whole; ſometimes the ſoul is put for the whole man. As when it is ſaid, <hi>there were ſo many ſouls in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act. 27. 37. Gen. 46. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhip with Paul.</hi> And <hi>ſeventy ſouls went down into Egypt with Jacob;</hi> ſometimes fleſh, or body, is put for the whole man, Rom. 12. 1. <hi>I beſeech you brethren, by the Mercies of God, offer up your bodies a living ſacrifice.</hi> That is, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up your <hi>ſelves.</hi> And ſometimes, <hi>fleſh,</hi> which is the word in the Text, Rom. 3. 20. <hi>Therefore, by the deeds of the Law, ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight,</hi> Compare that with, Pſal. 143. 2. where it is ſaid, <hi>In thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtified.</hi> No <hi>fleſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> No <hi>man,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> So fleſh is the whole man.</p>
                  <p>To clear this, ſome Quaeries would be reſolved. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaeries. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, whether Chriſt aſſumed the nature of man, or <note place="margin">1. Whether Chriſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or perſon of Man.</note> the perſon of a man, the whole man. He did aſſume the ſoul, as well as the body, both under the tearm, <hi>fleſh.</hi> And indeed, unleſſe, he had aſſumed the whole man, the whole man could not have been ſaved, ſaith <hi>Damazen. That which was not taken, could not be healed.</hi> If Chriſt had not taken the whole man, He could not have ſaved the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt Quaery, Whether the nature of man, or the perſon of man?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>The nature of man, and not a ſingle perſon.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſponſ. </seg>
                     </label> It will be dangerous to miſtake here. If Chriſt had onely <note place="margin">He aſſumed the nature, and not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſon.</note> taken the perſon of a man, then there muſt have been two perſons in Chriſt; a perſon aſſuming, and a perſon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Yea then, that onely perſon which Chriſt aſſumed, ſhould have been advanced, and ſaved; He ſhould have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that perſon, and no other, if he had aſſumed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a man. With us, the ſoul, and body, being united, make a perſon. But in Chriſt, the ſoul and body were ſo united, as to have their ſubſiſtence not of themſelves (as in us) but in the Godhead. No ſooner was the ſoul united in the body, but both ſoul and body had ſubſiſtence in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon in the Trinity. So, not the aſſuming of a perſon, but the nature of a man, common to all the ſons, and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Therefore <hi>he took not the nature of the Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Hebr. 2. 16. <hi>Seed,</hi> the firſt element of our nature, before our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons come to have any ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:168769:109"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Why did Chriſt take the nature of man? <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaery. </seg>2</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>That he might be a fit Mediator.</hi> That leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Why the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man.</note> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> giveth you, Hebr. 2. 14. <hi>Becauſe the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſp. </seg>2</label> 
                     <hi>of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">That he might be a fit Mediator.</note> 
                     <hi>had the power of death, that is, the Devill.</hi> His taking the nature of man, conduced to his being a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> For if he had not been man, he could not have died. And that he might be a fit <hi>Prophet:</hi> A <hi>Prophet will God raiſe up to you, like to me ſaith Moſes.</hi> It was fit, and convenient for them to have a man <hi>Prophet,</hi> becauſe they were not able to hear <hi>Angels,</hi> unleſſe they died. And that he might be a fit <hi>King:</hi> The head of one nature, and members of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make a Monſter, Hebr. 2. 11. <hi>Both he, that ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and they, that are ſanctified, are all of one nature.</hi> Chriſt is of the ſame nature with thoſe, that are ſanctified and governed by Him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third Quaery is, whether did Chriſt take <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaery. </seg>3</label> our nature in its Integrity, and perfection, as it was before <note place="margin">Whether he took our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as before the fall, or as after.</note> the fall, or our nature cloathed with infirmities, as after the fall?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, He took our nature cloathed with infirmities, as after the fall; which is implied in the word <hi>Fleſh.</hi> There <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſponſ. </seg>3</label> is a Reaſon, certainly, why the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> rather choſe to <note place="margin">He took our nature, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall.</note> ſay, Why, <hi>the Word was made fleſh,</hi> then why, <hi>the Word was made man;</hi> becauſe it is according to the phraſe of Scripture, when it would ſpeak contemptibly of man, and ſhew him to be the loweſt Creature, to call him, <hi>fleſh,</hi> when it would ſet forth the weakneſſe, that man is ſubject to. To give you one, or two Inſtances, inſtead of many, Pſal. 56. 4. <hi>I will not fear what fleſh can do unto me,</hi> that is, weak and infirm frail man; what Fleſh can do unto me. And again, Pſal. 78. 39. <hi>He remembreth that we are but fleſh, a wind that paſſeth away, and cometh not again.</hi> So then the word was made <hi>fleſh,</hi> that is, took not onely man's nature, but man's infirmities; which are expreſſed in that word <hi>fleſh.</hi> And that he did take our nature, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities thereof, appeareth by, Iſai. 53. 4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:168769:109"/> 4. The fourth Querie is, Whether Chriſt did take all the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaer. </seg>4</label> infirmities of our fleſh, yea or no? <note place="margin">Whether Chriſt took all our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon him?</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No. Our infirmities are of two ſorts; ſome <hi>penall</hi> and <hi>painfull infirmities;</hi> others <hi>ſinfull</hi> and <hi>culpable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi> Thoſe that are culpable and ſinfull, Chriſt did not take; for the Prince of this world came, and had nothing in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſponſ. Ne∣gativè. </seg>
                     </label> him. But thoſe that were penall infirmities, thoſe he took; but not all of them neither: for they are of two ſorts, either <note place="margin">Sinfull infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities Chriſt did not take; nor Penall, as Perſonall; but Penall, as Naturall.</note> 
                     <hi>Perſonall,</hi> proper to ſome few men and women, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by birth to the Stone, or Gout, or Strangury, or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, or ſome other hereditary diſeaſe; or <hi>Naturall,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> as to be ſubject to pain, and grief, and ſorrow, and hunger, and thirſt, and cold. The former of theſe Chriſt did not take, becauſe they would have been impediments to him in his Function; but the latter of theſe he did take.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Querie is, Why did Chriſt take theſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaer. </seg>5</label> implyed in the word <hi>fleſh?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Why did Chriſt take theſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, For diverſe ends, which I will but name, and have done. He took theſe infirmities of our nature, as well as the nature it ſelf, <hi>To ſhew the truth of his Humanity.</hi> He <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſponſ. </seg>
                     </label> had a nature that could hunger, and thirſt, even as other men <note place="margin">1. To ſhew the truth of his Humanity.</note> could. He took them, that he might ſanctifie them to us. Whatſoever Chriſt took, that he ſanctified. Saith <hi>Luther, Chriſt enriched poverty, by becoming poor; and glorified ſhame, by enduring ſhame for us.</hi> 2. He took our infirmities, <hi>That he might ſet us an example of an holy life.</hi> Had not <note place="margin">2. To give us an example of an holy life.</note> Chriſt been ſubject to paſſion, he could never have ſet us an <hi>example</hi> of meekneſſe or patience, if he himſelf had not been liable to paſſion, yet without ſin. Laſtly, He took <note place="margin">3. That we might have acceſſe to him with boldneſs</note> theſe infirmities, <hi>That we might confide the more in him, and have acceſſe to him with boldneſſe.</hi> Conſider him an <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> that was ſubject to infirmities as well as our ſelves. <hi>We have not an high Prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points touched as we are, yet without ſin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace.</hi> Thus ye ſee who is meant by the <hi>Word,</hi> and what is meant by <hi>Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <q>Sum, quod eram; quod eram, non ſum; nunc dicor utrumque.</q>
                  <p>It is ſaid in the Perſon of Chriſt, I am what I was, to wit, God ſtill; I was not what I am, to wit, Man; I am called both, to wit, God-Man. To clear it by the application of the Text, <hi>The Word was made fleſh. Chriſt</hi> is called the <hi>Word,</hi> particularly in reference to that internall word and conceptions, that are in a man's heart. Now if a man mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his own conceptions, What doth he do? He aſſumeth a voice, as it were, and, by that voice, makes men to hear what his conception is. This <hi>Word</hi> was that that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it was manifeſted in the fleſh, without any change of what he was. Here ye have the falſe ſenſe removed.</p>
                  <p>Let the true ſenſe now be aſſerted. <hi>The Word was made fleſh;</hi> that is, <hi>He aſſumed the Human Nature into</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">By aſſuming the human nature into the union of his Perſon.</note> 
                     <hi>the union of his perſon.</hi> He that was God before from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, doth now take man into the unity of his Perſon; onely there is this difference in it, The phraſe ſeemeth to import ſomething more, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi> And that ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> catch at, becauſe, they ſay, One thing cannot be made another without ſome <label type="milestone">

                  <p>For Anſwer to this, firſt, There is no neceſſity of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating <label type="milestone">

And ſome of our <hi>Kings</hi> have been made free of this City of <hi>London,</hi> in ſome Companies: and it was an honour to the <hi>Company,</hi> not a diſparagement to the <hi>Prince.</hi> So it is with Chriſt, He ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored that Nature he aſſumed, and not loſt that Nature which he had.

                  <p>We now come to what remaineth in the Particulars: See what they will afford us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which concerneth the Divinity of Chriſt, the <note place="margin">1. The Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom and the Love of God to be admired.</note> 
                     <hi>Word;</hi> what hath been ſaid of that, may ſerve to fill us all with admiration, of the love and wiſdom of our God, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo, that his own Son, the Second Perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the <hi>Word,</hi> ſhould be made <hi>fleſh</hi> for our ſalvation. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son.</hi> Here is love indeed! Hardly will a man part with an onely ſon, yet God doth; <hi>He ſpared not his own Son, but gave him to death for us all.</hi> And yet, haply, a man may have ſuch a ſon, that he careth not for; But what ſaith the voice from Heaven? <hi>This is my beloved Son.</hi> And yet he ſo loved the world, as to part with his <hi>beloved Son.</hi> One may have a ſon that he loveth, and yet be diſpleaſed with him, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was with <hi>Abſolom;</hi> but this Son did pleaſe the Father, and yet this Son is given to die. O the admirable love of God, ſhining in this, that the Second Perſon in the Trinity, is ſet on work to procure our Redemption! Though <hi>Reaſon</hi> could never have found out ſuch a way, yet, when God hath revealed it, <hi>Reaſon,</hi> though but <hi>ſhallow,</hi> can ſee a fitneſſe in it; becauſe there being a neceſſity, that the <hi>Saviour</hi> of man ſhould be Man, and an impoſſibility, that any but God ſhould ſave him; and one Perſon in the Trinity being to be Incarnate: It ſuiteth to reaſon, that the firſt Perſon in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168769:112"/> Trinity ſhould not be the <hi>Mediator;</hi> For who ſhould ſend him? He is of none, and therefore could not be ſent. There muſt be one ſent to reconcile the Enmity, and another to give gifts to friends; <hi>two proceeding Perſons,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> accordingly, the ſecond Perſon, which is the Son, he is ſent upon the firſt errand, to reconcile man to God; and the third Perſon, the Holy Ghoſt, he is ſent to give gifts to men, ſo reconciled. So as to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it is a ſuitable, and a very great congruity; That God having made all things by his <hi>Word,</hi> ſhould now repair all things by his <hi>Word.</hi> That as the word of the ſerpent deceived man, and brought him to ruine; ſo the <hi>Word</hi> of God ſhould reſtore him, and bring him to happineſſe. That he that was the middle perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſhould become the <hi>Mediator</hi> between God, and man; That he that was the expreſſe Image of the Father's perſon, ſhould reſtore the Image of God, defaced in man by his ſins. Men may be too curious in ſuch <hi>Quaeries,</hi> but where there is a bottom in the love of God, we may ſafely loſe our ſelves in the admiration of the wiſdome of God, in the Contrivance of the work of our Redemption. That for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From what hath been ſaid of the word, <hi>fleſh,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Here is both matter of Comfort, and matter of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> here, as importing the human nature, and the human nature cloathed with infirmities, we may gather both matter of <hi>Comfort,</hi> and matter of <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Matter of Comfort from each of the two branches; from <hi>fleſh,</hi> as it importeth <hi>man-hood;</hi> from <hi>fleſh,</hi> as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth infirmity of <hi>man-hood.</hi> The Son of God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our nature upon him, that may Comfort men; It is matter of Rejoycing to any man, when he heareth his friend is preferred. What is ſo neer to us as our owne nature? Behold our nature is preferred by Jeſus Chriſt, to a union <note place="margin">Our nature preferr'd by Chriſt, to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> in the Godhead. Chriſt ſitteth in Heaven with our nature, and the ſame <hi>fleſh</hi> that we have upon us, onely <hi>glorified.</hi> It is that, which all the World cannot give a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of, why the ſame word in the <hi>Hebrew, Raſhar,</hi> ſhould ſignifie both <hi>fleſh,</hi> and <hi>good Tydings; Divinity</hi> will give you a reaſon, though <hi>Grammar</hi> cannot. Chriſt's taking of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:168769:112"/> fleſh upon him, was good Tydings to all the whole World; therefore, no wonder if one word ſignifie both. Aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of comfort may be taken from hence to poor ſouls, when they think God hath forgotten them; To conſider, Is it likely, that Chriſt that is man, ſhould forget Man, now He is at the right hand of the Father, cloathed in that nature that we have. When we are troubled to think it is impoſſible, God and man ſhould ever be reconciled; Let us conſider, that God, and man, did meet in Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is poſſible, we may meet; What hath been, may be again. The two natures met in Chriſt, therefore God may be reconciled to man; yea, they therefore met, that God might be reconciled to man. He was made <hi>Emanuell</hi> God with us; that he might bring God, and us together. When a man is troubled to think of the Corruptions of his nature, that is ſo full of defilement, that it cannot be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; let him withall think, that his nature is capable of ſanctification to the full. Chriſt received human nature, which was not polluted, his nature is the ſame; Therefore, that nature is capable of ſanctification to the uttermoſt. Many more comforts may be raiſed from this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That he aſſumed fleſh, with the ſorrows of it, and the nature of it; penall infirmities. The conſideration of that in generall, may give ſome comfort to men, becauſe it letteth us ſee, that Chriſt is able, and willing to help us, becauſe he hath taken our infirmities. Both theſe the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> holdeth out, Hebr. 2. ult. It is ſaid, <hi>In that he himſelf had ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> He is therefore able, becauſe himſelfe hath been tempted. As a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> that trieth the vertue of ſome ſoveraign Compoſition upon his owne body, he is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to cure another, with that Receit, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath tried it. Chriſt hath born our infirmities, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knoweth better how to ſupport us under them. I, but is he willing? yes, His willingneſſe may be collected from this, That he hath taken our infirmities, Hebr. 2. 17. <hi>He was made like unto his brethren in all things, that he might be a mercifull high Prieſt.</hi> Chriſt is therefore a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull high Prieſt, becauſe he was made like us in our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168769:113"/> It is a great invitation to mercy, to ſee one in the ſame condition that we our ſelves have been in. As ſhe ſaid, <hi>Haud ignara mali, miſeris ſuccurrere diſco,</hi> ſhe <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dido.</hi> Lib. 3. Aenaeid.</note> had learned to pity others, becauſe ſhe had born the like miſeries her ſelfe. As a woman that hath had a Child, can more pity women that are in Travaile, becauſe ſhe hath ſuffered the like pains; than other women can, that never have brought forth any Children at all. So the Lord Jeſus hath felt the like infirmities, the <hi>penall,</hi> not the <hi>ſinfull;</hi> therefore he is likely to pitty us, when we lie under them, Exod. 23. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe a ſtranger, for ye know</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">They that have ſuffered, can beſt pitty them that are under ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> 
                     <hi>the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt.</hi> Chriſt knoweth the heart of a man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his infirmities, when they are onely painfull, and not ſinfull, becauſe he himſelfe did undergoe ſuch in the dayes of his fleſh. Therefore, this may comfort a man as in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, ſo in diverſe particular Caſes; when we wreſtle with infirmities, ſuppoſe ſorrow of heart, it was Chriſt's owne caſe. Time was, when he cried out, Matth. 26. 38. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even to death.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his ſorrow, may help to ſweeten thine, when thou art afflicted in body, and pinched. It was Chriſt's caſe, He himſelfe hungred in the wilderneſſe, and was a thirſt at <hi>Jacob's</hi> well. He was buffetted, and ſcourged, yea, Crucified in the end, He felt the nails and ſpear. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> I am aſhamed, that men ſhould count my ſufferings any thing, when I think of what Chriſt indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; So, be our ſufferings never ſo great, we are thereby made conformable to him, who ſuffered the like things for us. And ſo for poverty, 2 Cor. 8. 9. <hi>Ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, though he were rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that you through his poverty might be made rich.</hi> The like may be ſaid in many other Inſtances: whatſoever infirmity it is, we may expect, Chriſt will relieve us againſt it.</p>
                  <p>But the ſoul ſaith, Still you except ſin, I would have that taken away. If Chriſt take not that away, I am undone. <label type="milestone">

                  <p> I told you, Chriſt took our painfull infirmities, and not <label type="milestone">

He took our painfull infirmities, in a way of <hi>Inherency;</hi> and our ſinfull ones too, in a way of <hi>Iniputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Quicquid ſuſtulit, tollit,</hi> whatſoever Chriſt took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he took. He took away our ſins, therefore he took our ſins, in one ſenſe, or other; He could not take our ſins, as our ſorrowes. It was impoſſible, that ſin ſhould be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Chriſt; His Divinity was a protection againſt all ſins, yet He took them away by imputation. Therefore, It is ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle, God hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin;</hi> He knew no ſin, and yet is made ſin. How? Not made ſin, by committing ſin, for Chriſt was not in a Capacity of ſinning; but made ſin, by bearing the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> of ſin; and ſo took upon him the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin, and not the <hi>Inherency</hi> of ſin.</p>
                  <p>There be two things in guilt, a <hi>worthineſſe</hi> of being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and a <hi>deſtination</hi> to puniſhment; The <hi>Demerit,</hi> and the <hi>Deſtination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is falſe to ſay, That Chriſt took the guilt upon him, in a way of Demerit; as if Chriſt himſelfe had been worthy of being puniſhed. For all Demerit implieth ſin, either naturall, or perſonall; Now in Chriſt, was neither origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Corruption, nor actuall Rebellion. But the other thing in guilt, which is, <hi>Poenae obligatio,</hi> an obligation, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to puniſhment. In this ſenſe, Chriſt took guilt, not becauſe of any naturall Demerit, but becauſe of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in that nature, of which the Demerit was found; He voluntarily became our Surety, and took our Nature, that, in that nature, He might ſuffer for our ſins. And in this capacity, God doth deſtinate him to puniſhment; in this ſenſe, He took our ſinfull infirmities. And thus ye ſee, what matter of comfort this truth affordeth.</p>
                  <p>It affordeth us likewiſe matter of duty. Leſſons of piety, and Leſſons of thankfullneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Leſſons of piety:</hi> Oh, If Chriſt the ſecond Perſon <note place="margin">1 Leſſons of piety.</note> in the Triuity, did put on man, how carefull ſhould men be to put on Chriſt? <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:168769:114"/> 
                     <hi>not making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. 14. If Chriſt aſſumed our human nature, how ſhould we wreſtle with God, to be made partakers of the Divine nature, 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pretious Promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine nature, having eſcaped the corruptions that are in the World through luſts.</hi> If Chriſt became thus one fleſh with us, how zealous ſhould we be to become one ſpirit with Chriſt? 1 Cor. 6. 17. <hi>Even as man, and wife, is one fleſh; ſo he that is joyned to the Lord, is one ſpirit;</hi> So ſhe is married to Chriſt, and God looketh upon ſuch a ſoul, as his owne daughter, now it is married to his Son; therefore dealeth with it, as <hi>Caleb</hi> did to <hi>Achſah.</hi> He giveth her not onely the upper Land, and nether ſprings, not onely outward bleſſings, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, but comforts, and refreſhments with them; not onely the nether ſprings of Ordinances, but the upper ſprings of Comforts, and Refreſhments in, and by, thoſe Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here are <hi>Leſſons of thankfullneſſe too.</hi> Was the Word made fleſh? Did Chriſt take our nature? yea, <note place="margin">2 Leſſons of thankfullneſs.</note> did he take our nature at the worſt, after the Fall? What exceeding great cauſe have we to bleſſe his Name for ever; for this Condeſcenſion of his? Should all the Princes in the World, have come from their ſeverall Thrones, and have gone a begging from door to door, it was not ſo much, as for Chriſt to become man for our ſakes. And he took our nature not in the integrity of it, as in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, but in the infirmities of it, which came to it by the fall; As, for a man that can live of himſelfe, to wear a Noble man's Livery, while this Noble man is in great favour in the Court, and hath the King's eare, this is no ſuch great matter: But when this Noble man is proclaimed a <hi>Traitor,</hi> and is caſt out of his Prince's favour, then for this man to wear his Cloath, and owne him, this is ſomething hard. This is the Caſe, for Chriſt to have taken our nature as it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> while he ſtood cloathed in his Integrity, and flood right in the ſight of God; had not been ſo much, as when <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, and proclaimed <hi>Traitor.</hi> As <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:168769:114"/> ſaith, <hi>Quò pro me vilior, eò mihi charior, Domine,</hi> Lord, thou ſhalt be ſo much the more dear to me, by how much the more thou haſt been vile for me. Here is Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion indeed, that Chriſt ſhould ſtoop ſo low to take fleſh, and fleſh wlth infirmities. You know what King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> did, when he met with the paſſage in the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> which laid open, what good ſervice <hi>Mordecay</hi> had done for him; ſaith he, <hi>What hath been done for this man?</hi> and when he ſaw nothing was done, he thinks preſently of advancing him, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6. 3. Let us call to our ſelves, and ſay, What hath been done for this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that hath done ſo much for my ſoul? If nothing at all; It is time to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this duty, and to think of ſome way to Teſtifie our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe to Chriſt. How ſhall we do it? Chriſt is above, we are not able to reach Him. True, but He hath mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers here on Earth, though He be in Heaven; He will take it as done to himſelfe, if ye do it to one of them. Would you be thankfull to Chriſt, be kind to his people. Kings, when they go their progreſſe, and come to this, and that Town, and are preſented with ſome ſumme of Money, or piece of Plate; the Preſent they receive, to give the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple content, but they give away the thing to ſome of their <hi>Favourites.</hi> So it is with Chriſt, He giveth away the things ye tender him, he taketh it well; but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that his Children ſhould have what you give. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtandeth in no need of what we can do; but if we do it to his people, he will accept it, as if it was done to himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 40. Therefore <hi>David</hi> maketh a full Confeſſion of this, Pſal. 16. 2, 3. <hi>Thou art my Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my goodneſſe extendeth not to thee, but to the Saints on the Earth, and to the Excellent, in whom is all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</hi> You ſee what uſe may be made now, of what was ſaid of the Divine nature of Chriſt, as he is called the <hi>Word;</hi> what of his human nature, as he is ſaid, to be made <hi>fleſh;</hi> and what followeth, and what hath been ſaid of the perſonall union of theſe two natures.</p>
                  <p>Ye may from hence, take a view of one of the <hi>deepeſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The greateſt myſtery in the World, is the <hi>Word</hi> made fleſh.</note>

                  <p>And this is one of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>Subſtantiall union</hi> of three Perſons in one <note place="margin">1. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Nature, and <hi>one Subſtance:</hi> So, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> make but <hi>One God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>Perſonall union,</hi> of two Natures <note place="margin">2. The Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union.</note> in <hi>one Perſon:</hi> So, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> make but one <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is the Union of Severall, both <hi>Perſons,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call union.</note> and <hi>Natures,</hi> in one <hi>Myſticall body;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> together, make but one Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head.</p>
                  <p>Here are the three great Myſteries of Religion. <hi>That</hi> I ſpeak of, is the ſecond of theſe, <hi>The Perſonall union.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt of theſe, <hi>Divines</hi> uſe to obſerve, that there is <hi>alius</hi> and <hi>alius,</hi> but not <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>aliud;</hi> another <hi>Perſon,</hi> but not another <hi>Thing.</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> is, <hi>Alius a Filio,</hi> a diſtinct Perſon from the <hi>Son;</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> is, <hi>Alius à ſancto Spiritu,</hi> a diſtinct Perſon from the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> but not a diſtinct <hi>Thing.</hi> The <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> make but one <hi>Eſſence,</hi> there is not <hi>aliud</hi> to be found in them.</p>
                  <p>In the Second is <hi>aliud,</hi> but not <hi>alius;</hi> a diſtinct <hi>Thing,</hi> but not diſtinct <hi>Perſons:</hi> The <hi>Human Nature</hi> is a diſtinct <hi>thing</hi> from the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and the <hi>Godhead</hi> a diſtinct <hi>thing</hi> from the <hi>Manhood,</hi> but not a diſtinct <hi>perſon</hi> from the <hi>Manhood;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> make but <hi>one Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Third, the <hi>Myſticall union,</hi> there is both <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>alius,</hi> but not <hi>alienus:</hi> There is <hi>diſtinct Things,</hi> and <hi>diſtinct Perſons;</hi> the <hi>Angelicall Nature</hi> and <hi>Human Nature;</hi> the perſons of <hi>Believers,</hi> and the Perſon of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but there is not <hi>alienus</hi> amongſt them. One of theſe are united to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in near relation; they are not <hi>aliud,</hi> one from another. Though there be <hi>different things,</hi> and <hi>different perſons,</hi> there
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168769:115"/> is a union between them. That is one thing that ye may learn from hence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Ye may learn from hence a ground of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Properties, which is a very myſterious thing in Religion; that which they call, <hi>Communicatio Idiomatum,</hi> a thing not ſo eaſily underſtood. But by reaſon of this perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union of the two Natures in Chriſt, there is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Properties; that is, That which belongeth to the <hi>Manhood,</hi> may be aſcribed and given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the <hi>Godhead;</hi> and that that belongeth to the <hi>Godhead,</hi> may be denominated to Chriſt, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the <hi>Manhood.</hi> A man may truly ſay, The Son of <note place="margin">How the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> made the world, and how the Son of God ſhed his blood</note> 
                     <hi>Mary</hi> made the world. Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> is denominated from his human Nature; but it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God</hi> that made the world, not <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> for he was not the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> till many thouſand years after the world was made. On the other ſide, you may ſay, <hi>The Son of God was crucified, and ſhed his blood upon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Croſſe.</hi> Here ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the denomination of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> which belongeth to him as Man; to ſhed his blood, as God, he hath none to ſhed. But yet, this may properly be ſaid, becauſe the Perſon is both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> It is not without precedent in Scripture, Joh. 3. 13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</hi> Chriſt here, when he converſed upon earth, he ſaid, The Son of man was in heaven; Why? Becauſe that Perſon was in heaven according to his <hi>Godhead;</hi> and yet the Son of man denominated from the <hi>Godhead,</hi> is ſaid to be in heaven, whereas nothing more certain, that <hi>Chriſt-Man</hi> was upon earth, and yet in heaven, as <hi>God.</hi> And ſo on the other ſide, Act. 20. 28. <hi>Take heed to the flock, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> God hath no blood, yet God is ſaid to purchaſe the Church with his blood; becauſe that Perſon which was God, had blood to ſhed, according to his human Nature; though it was <hi>ſanguis humanus,</hi> yet it was <hi>ſanguis Dei.</hi> It was human blood, yet the blood of that Perſon, which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:168769:116"/> was God as well as Man. Now the ground of all this, is that perſonall union, <hi>The Word being made fleſh. Divines</hi> have laboured much to make this clear, therefore have invented divers Compariſons; I ſhall tell you of one or two of them. They ſuppoſe a flaming fiery Sword; here is a union of the metal and of the fire, that are met together in this ſword; and therefore there may be a communication of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This fiery thing may be ſaid to cut, and this ſharp thing may be ſaid to burn, becauſe they are ſo united in one ſword. Or thus, They ſuppoſe a man under two capacities, one and the ſame man that hath skill in two Sciences; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he is both a good <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> and a good <hi>Lawyer.</hi> Now one may, in propriety of ſpeech, ſay, This <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and this <hi>Lawyer</hi> is a <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> becauſe both meet in one man. A man may ſay, This <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is a diligent follower of his <hi>Clyent</hi>'s buſineſſe, and this <hi>Lawyer</hi> is very good at curing his <hi>Patients.</hi> Or thus, A branch of a <hi>Vine</hi> is graffed into the ſtock of an <hi>Olive-tree,</hi> and that ſo, as it takes of each tree: both the Vine-branch and the Olive bear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall natures, yet are in the union both of one tree; but both Grapes and Olives grow upon it. One may ſay, This Vine beareth good Olives, and this Olive-tree beareth good Grapes, becauſe united in one tree. So it is in reſpect of the <hi>Manhood</hi> united to the <hi>Godhead.</hi> This <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> made the world, and this <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhed his blood upon the Croſſe. But, no more of this, <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi>

The Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt dwelt in the human Nature</note> phraſe, <hi>Dwelt amongſt us,</hi> is an amplification of the former, <hi>The Word was made fleſh;</hi> and implyeth this, That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of Chriſt dwelleth in the human Nature as in a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sojourners,</hi> Secondly: as the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, they dwelt in <hi>Tents,</hi> and, in memory of that, they after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> kept the feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> Pſal. 120. 5. <hi>Wee is me, that I ſojourn in Meſheck, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt was all theſe three, a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Sojourner,</hi> and a <hi>Souldier,</hi> and therefore is ſaid, to dwell, in theſe three reſpects, as in a Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As the great and good Shepherd, for both theſe <note place="margin">1. Chriſt the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</note> terms are given to him, Joh 10. 11. <hi>I am the good ſhepherd,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the good ſhepherd giveth his Life for his ſheep.</hi> That is a good ſhepherd indeed! Other ſhepherds they provide food for their ſheep, but they cannot give them a fleece; Chriſt provideth both food, and fleece for his ſheep. And whereas other <hi>ſhepherds</hi> ſell their ſheep to the ſlaughter, that they themſelves may be maintained by them; here is a <hi>ſhepherd</hi> ſlaughtered for his ſheep, <hi>I am the good ſhepherd, the good ſhepherd giveth his Life for the ſheep.</hi> Some other good <hi>ſhepherds</hi> may venture their life for their ſheep; As <hi>David</hi> run a hazard, to venture his Life to reſcue the ſheep from the Lion. But Chriſt did more than
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:168769:118"/> run a hazard, for He gave his Life.</p>
                  <p>Then Chriſt dwelt in Tents as a Sojourner. Ye have a <note place="margin">2. Chriſt a Sojourner.</note> diſtinction of <hi>Viatores,</hi> and <hi>Comp chenſo es,</hi> amongſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;</hi> They ſay, that all the people of God in their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage towards Heaven, are <hi>Viatores,</hi> and the Saints above in the ſtate of Glory, are <hi>Comprehenſores,</hi> in that they are at home; now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he is both. There is that difference between a Saint in Heaven, and a Saint on this ſide Heaven. Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, was at once a <hi>Traveller,</hi> and a <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi> For he alwayes had the fruition of God, in that reſpect he was a <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor;</hi> and yet in the 33 years of his abode in the fleſh, he was a <hi>Viator,</hi> and a <hi>Traveller</hi> in the way; therefore he is ſaid, to have <hi>drunk of the brook in the way.</hi> He ſpeaks of a <hi>ſojourner,</hi> as one going to, and fro, Joh. 16. 8. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the World; and again I leave the World, and go to the Father.</hi> Here is his <hi>Jiſtes,</hi> as it were ſeverall journies, that Chriſt took in the dayes of his Pilgrimage, as a <hi>Sojourner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He pitcht his Tents here amongſt men, as a <note place="margin">3. Chriſt a Souldier.</note> 
                     <hi>Souldier,</hi> for indeed ſo he is. Ever ſince the fall, the World hath been divided into two parts, all ſhall be united then, but now the Devill goeth away with the greateſt part, as the Prince of this World, and the Lord Jeſus appeared on the other ſide, as the Captain of our ſalvation. Ye have him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion, Hebr. 2. 10. <hi>It became him, from whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect through ſufferings.</hi> Accordingly he appeared to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuah,</hi> Joſ. 5. 13. <hi>with a ſword in his hand, as the Captain of the Lord's hoſts.</hi> Therefore it is, that when a man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, the Apoſtle's phraſe is, <hi>That he may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to Satan;</hi> becauſe he is now caſt our of the viſible Church, and ſo deduced again unto Satan's government. In all theſe reſpects, ye ſee, both as a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> a <hi>Sojourner,</hi> and a <hi>Souldier;</hi> Chriſt is properly ſaid to pitch his Tents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, which is the importance of the Greek word in the Text.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not paſſe this over without ſome Application, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:168769:118"/> The conſideration of Chriſt's dwelling amongſt us, may be of uſe, to let us ſee, the Faithfullneſſe of God for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and the Condeſcention of Chriſt for our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The faithfullneſſe of God, for our incouragement: <note place="margin">1. Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for our incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Be pleaſed to look into <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Leviticus,</hi> you ſhall find an old promiſe, <hi>that God would come and dwell amongſt his people.</hi> It is ſaid in Exodus 12. 43. <hi>I will dwell amongſt the Children of Iſrael, and will be their God.</hi> It is ſaid, Leviticus 26. 12. <hi>I will walk amongſt you, and will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> Now this promiſe, is of the nature of diverſe, in the Scripture, that have their graduall accompliſhments, and are fulfilled, by piece-meal, by degrees; <hi>I will dwell amongſt you,</hi> ſaith God, He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed then, when the people of Iſrael were in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The firſt fulfilling of this promiſe was, when the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was made in the wilderneſſe, that was a Teſtimony of the preſence of God. A further fulfilling of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was, when <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple, 2 Chron. 6. 2. <hi>I have built an houſe, and habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever.</hi> But when Chriſt came in the fleſh, here was a farther fulfilling of that promiſe; Then came He, of whoſe Body the Tabernacle, and Temple, were but types. <hi>Deſtroy this Temple,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will build it up in three daies, ſpeaking of his body;</hi> now here is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fulfilled in a remarkable way: and yet there is to be a farther fulfilling of the ſame promiſe ſtill. That ye may ſee, that God maketh good the ſame promiſe many times, diverſe times over, Revel. 21. 3. <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelfe ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> There is a farther ſtate of happineſſe yet to come, wherein this promiſe is to be made good, <hi>That God will dwell amongſt men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſee the Condeſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">2. Chriſt's Condeſcenſion to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men.</note> though, <hi>He was the delight of his Father from all Eternity,</hi> Prov. 8. Yet to ſhew his delight to the ſons of men, he will come and dwell amongſt them, Prov. 8. 31. <hi>I was by him, as one brought up with him, I was daily his delight,</hi>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:168769:119"/> 
                     <hi>rejoycing alwaies before him, rejoycing in the habitable parts of the world, and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> To manifeſt this, before he did actually come in the fleſh, he was often pleaſed to take a body for a time, and to lay it down again; to appear in human ſhape, <hi>praeludere In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnationi,</hi> as they uſe to call it; He acted the Prologue of his Incarnation, before he came really. He appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>Joſhua.</hi> But after he did aſſume a reall body into perſonall union with himſelf, which he did never till now, he took it of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Here is infinite condeſcention, that he who lay in the Father's boſome, ſhould not abhor the Virgin's womb. If it were ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Moſes</hi> his faith, Heb. 11. though he were in great pomp at the Court; yet, <hi>by faith he choſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer afflictions with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Though he were a favourite at Court, yet he would joyn himſelf with a ſort of poor <hi>Brick-makers.</hi> Then, what a condeſcention is it of the love of God, that he would ſend his Son to dwell amongſt us, poor duſt and aſhes!</p>
                  <p>Then, from Chriſt's dwelling amongſt us as in a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <note place="margin">1. As our Shepheard, he protects us in our fallen condition.</note> as it referreth to his condition as a <hi>Shepheard.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we may learn from hence; Whom to have recourſe to, and to be protected by, in our fallen and relapſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>We were all as ſheep going aſtray,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. ult. <hi>but are now returned to the Shepheard of our ſouls.</hi> Poor ſheep, going aſtray, and muſt for ever go aſtray, they cannot know the way to return home. But now, Lo, Chriſt commeth, dwelleth, and pitcheth his tents amongſt us, that under him we may have protection. <hi>I ſhall want nothing,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, for the Lord is my ſhepheard,</hi> Pſal. 23. ult. Seeing Chriſt came to pitch his tents, we ſhould hear his voice; <hi>My ſheep hear my voice.</hi> Now Chriſt is in heaven, no voice is to be heard but by the Miniſtry: therefore all thoſe Exhortations which the Miniſter giveth to the people, they all come from this great <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and are accordingly to be heeded. Eccleſ. 12. 11. <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads, and as nails faſtned by the maſters of aſſemblies, which are given by one ſhepheard.</hi> Thoſe Officers which Chriſt hath faſtned
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:168769:119"/> in the Church, they are as nailes faſtned to the Aſſemblies. Therefore ſuch as liſten to the voice of <hi>inferiour ſhepheard,</hi> according to the Word, when this <hi>great Shepheard</hi> ſhall come, they ſhall receive a Crown of life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt pitched his tents amongſt us as a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Chriſt, as a Sojourner, teacheth us, to reckon our ſelves ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the world.</note> This ſhould teach us to be conformed to Chriſt, even in this particular. He did but pitch a tent, he did not take up his aboad upon the face of the earth. We muſt carry our ſelves as ſtrangers and pilgrims in the world, and not look at our ſelves as at home here. Ye know what the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, <hi>I am a ſtranger,</hi> Pſal. 39. 12. <hi>Hear my prayers, O Lord, and give ear to my cry, hold not thy peace at my tears; for I am a ſtranger with thee, and a ſojourner as all my fathers were.</hi> Ye know what is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Patriarks</hi> of old; they dwelt in tents, ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 11. 8, 9. <hi>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place, which he ſhould after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither he went. By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe as in a ſtrange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maker is God.</hi> And ſo, verſ. 16. <hi>Now they deſired a better country, that is, an heavenly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beloved, not to dwell hear, Look about you, and ye will find nothing but <hi>Tabernacles;</hi> no <hi>Manſions,</hi> till ye come to heaven. While we live, What are our bodies, but as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>tabernacles</hi> to our ſouls? It is a Scripture-expreſſion, 2 Pet. 1. 13, 14. <hi>I think it meet; as long as I am in this tabernacle, to ſtir you up, knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this tabernacle.</hi> While we live, our bodies are but <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles</hi> to our ſouls; and when we are dead, the graves are but <hi>tabernaeles</hi> to our bodies. Pſal. 16. 9. <hi>Therefore did my heart rejoyce, and my tongue was glad; moreover my body ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> Becauſe neither muſt our ſouls remain long in our bodies, nor our bodies in the grave. If we will have <hi>Manſions,</hi> we muſt look to <hi>Heaven, In my Father's houſe are many manſions.</hi> Therefore dream not of <hi>manſions</hi> here below.</p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:168769:120"/>
                  <p> Thirdly, Chriſt pitched his tent amongſt us, as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">3. Chriſt, as a Souldier, learneth us to be encouraged</note> of our ſalvation. Let this encourage us; we have one that's able to encounter with Satan, if he bring all his forces into the field together. Let him be a roaringlion, here is a ruling Lion, <hi>the Lion of the tribe of Judah,</hi> that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter him; that putteth upon us the whole armour of God. They ſay, that a very Army of <hi>Harts</hi> and <hi>Hares,</hi> led by a <hi>Lion,</hi> their Commander, are able to do great matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Leader</hi> putteth courage into them by his valour. Let Chriſt put courage into us. As that great Commander ſaid, when the Scouts came and told him, that ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were comming againſt him, more than they were: Why, ſaith he, How many thouſands do you reckon me for? intimating; that he was worth many thouſands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. So, For how many thouſands do you reckon Chriſt, when you go out againſt the World, and the Fleſh, and the Devill? I paſſe to the next.</p>

                  <p>Here is the ſpeciall manifeſtation of Chriſt's glory. The Diſciples beheld the glory of Chriſt, as the glory of the onely begotten Son of the Father. Let us take the words as they lie.

                  <p>Ye have heard what the Object is, <hi>the glory of Chriſt, We beheld his glory,</hi> which is the ſhining forth of excellency; ſuch appeared in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p> The ſpecification of that Object, What kind of glory? Why, <hi>the glory as of the onely-begotten of the Father.</hi> Ye read in Scripture of ſeverall ſorts of glory.</p>
                  <p>There is the glory of the <hi>Celeſtiall bodies,</hi> the Sun, <note place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>We read of the glory of <hi>Man,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 24. <hi>All fleſh is</hi>

                  <p>We read likewiſe of the glory of the <hi>Angels,</hi> who are <note place="margin">3.

                  <p>Firſt, In his <hi>Oracles,</hi> namely his diſcourſes, and Sermons, and Heavenly ſayings, that proceeded out of his mouth.

It is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>He touched the bier, and they ſtood ſtill, And Chriſt ſaid, I ſay to thee, Ariſe.</hi> Here Chriſt ſpeaks to men, <hi>I ſay to thee:</hi> whereas, what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, they acknowledged it done, not by their owne power, but by Chriſt, Acts 3. 12, 13. <hi>And when Peter ſaw it, he anſwered unto the people, Ye men of Iſrael, why marvail ye at this? or why look ye ſo earneſtly on us, as though by our own power, and holineſſe, we had made this man to walk; The God of Abraham, and of Iſaack, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Son Jeſus, whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the preſence of Pilate: His Name, through faith in his</hi>

                     <hi>glory;</hi> Some piece of an anſwer God gave him, when he paſſed before him, and ſhewed ſome piece of his glory. But here God ſheweth his glory upon mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> when Chriſt was Transfigured; <hi>We beheld his glory,</hi> namely, at the <hi>Transfiguration. John</hi> was one there, and <hi>Peter</hi> was another, as well as <hi>John.</hi> And he ſpeaks dearly of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. For he telleth you of the voice that came from the excellent glory; ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> Referring to that time, and that place, the time of our <hi>Saviours Transfiguration</hi> upon that <hi>Mount,</hi> Mark 9. 2, 3, 4, 5. verſ. <hi>And after ſix daies, Jeſus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain, apart by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and he was transfigured before them; and his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment became ſhining exceeding white as ſnow, ſo as no ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler on earth can whiten them. And there appeared unto them Elias, with Moſes, and they were talking with Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>

As you may underſtand that in Timothy, <hi>Great is the myſtery of</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, take notice of one great end of Chriſt's Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his glory.</hi> Till then, the glory of Chriſt was inviſible; but now, by taking fleſh, he expoſed himſelf and his glory to view: <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. Indeed, the fleſh of Chriſt was a vail to him, but a mirror and glaſſe to us. To him a Vail, to obſerve the glory which he had from all Eternity with God the Father, as the Son of God; but to us a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in which we beheld this glory of God, which was never till now expoſed to view, or not ſo fully. As God is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo his glory is too dazling for our weak eyes. But we that cannot behold the Sun in its ſphear, may behold the Sun in a baſon of water. We that cannot behold the glory of God, as in it ſelf, may behold it in Chriſt, in the veil of his fleſh. Therefore he was manifeſted, that he might be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Be exhorted from hence, to take a view of <note place="margin">2. Let us take a view of his glory, as the Diſciples did.</note> the glory of Chriſt, as the Diſciples did: We cannot in the ſame manner, yet we have one way wherein we may do it: For Chriſt expoſeth himſelf and his glory to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the glaſſe of the Goſpell; 2 Cor. 3. ult. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſſe the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be our care to do as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts us, <hi>to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up to Jeſus.</hi> That is very emphaticall, Heb. 12. 2. <hi>Looking unto Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith; who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of God.</hi> The word is, <gap reason="foreign">

Certainly, brethren, we have preſidents for this; take <hi>Paul,</hi> a man that buſied himſelf in this great work, of beholding the glory of Chriſt, throughout his whole courſe, after his converſion; therefore he deſired no other learnlng but Chriſt crucified, 1 Cor. 2. 2. <hi>I determined not to know any thing amongſt you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> He valued no other wealth, <note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before all things.</note> but <hi>the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I count all things but loſſe and droſſe, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord; for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Where was his learning, and wealth, and joy, and great delight? It was in the beholding of Chriſt; he gloried in nothing elſe, Gal. 6. 14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Beloved, the Croſſe of Chriſt ſhall be our Crown, if we love to make the glory of Chriſt our ſtudy.</p>

His hath a glory far above theirs, above the glory of the <hi>Celeſtiall bodies,</hi> and the glory of <hi>Men,</hi> above the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Cherubims.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle taketh a great deal of pains, to prefer <hi>Chriſt</hi> above the <hi>Angels,</hi> that our thoughts may go beyond in the excellency of Chriſt above any other creatures. Whence it is, that Joh. 5. 23. <hi>all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.

Thoſe graces which were ſcattered amongſt the Saints, one excelling in this grace, another in that; <hi>Moſes</hi> in meekneſſe, <hi>Job</hi> in patience, <hi>David</hi> in thankfulneſſe, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> in chaſtity, and ſo in the reſt; they are all united in Chriſt. So for the meaſure and degrees of grace, as he hath of all kinds, ſo the utmoſt degree of every kind. To Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, graces are given in a ſcant proportion, and meaſured out, according as God hath allotted to every one his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, Epheſ. 4. 7. <hi>Unto every one of us is grace given, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt.</hi> But to Chriſt himſelf, it is above meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. God gave not the Spirit by meaſure to him; he doth not ſtand meting it out, but poureth it out upon him. So that look whatſoever grace a human nature, void of ſin, is capable of, that was all poured out upon Chriſt: <hi>Full of grace. It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe</hi>

                     <hi>grace of Acceptation.</hi> In that ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 40. ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>The Child grew, and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdome, and the grace of God was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him;</hi> that is, the favour of God. So he interpreteth it in the laſt verſe of that Chapter; <hi>Jeſus increaſed in wiſdom, and ſtature, and favour with God, and men.</hi> We needs muſt grant it to be ſo, becauſe, <hi>Quod efficit tale, magis eſt tale,</hi> That which maketh another ſo, is much more ſo, it ſelfe. Chriſt is he, that procureth acceptation both of our perſons, and our ſervices; and therefore, he himſelfe is much more acceptable with God. Our <hi>perſons</hi> have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, but through him. We are ſaid, <hi>to be accepted through the beloved,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 6. Our <hi>ſervices</hi> have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation but through him. In that place of <hi>Peter,</hi> we are a <hi>ſpirituall prieſt-hood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5, 6. <hi>Offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> So as He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is much more accepted. Thus you ſee, how he is, <hi>full of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us ſee now, how Chriſt is likewiſe, <hi>full of Truth.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt in the truth, and the truth in Him.</note> The truth is ſaid to be in Jeſus, and Jeſus is ſaid to be in the truth. Truth is ſaid to be in him, Epheſ. 4. 21. <hi>If ſo be ye have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> He is ſaid to be The truth, <hi>John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 14. 6. I am the way, <hi>the Truth, and the Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly, Take truth in what notion you will, it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:168769:126"/> will appear Chriſt was, <hi>full of truth. Truth</hi> is ſometimes oppoſed to <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Error,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Lying,</hi> ſometimes to <hi>Shadowes.</hi> Chriſt was full of truth, in all theſe ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If ye take <hi>Truth,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and as <note place="margin">1. Chriſt is full of Truth, as oppoſed to Hypocriſie.</note> equipollent with <hi>ſincerity, not with the levened bread of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but with the unlevened bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. So Chriſt was <hi>full of Truth,</hi> ſincere in all. When he lifted up his <hi>eyes,</hi> he lifted up his <hi>heart</hi> to God. When he bowed his <hi>knee,</hi> he bowed his <hi>ſoul.</hi> When he opened his <hi>mouth,</hi> he opened his <hi>heart</hi> to his hearers. Therefore he is ſaid to be girt about the loins with <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> and <hi>truth; Righteouſneſſe, and truth, ſhall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulneſſe, the girdle of his reins.</hi> As the girdle girts a man in; ſo <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> girt in all the actions, and ſpeeches of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If ye take <hi>Truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in oppoſition <note place="margin">2. As oppoſed to Error.</note> to <hi>Error;</hi> thus Chriſt was, <hi>full of truth,</hi> becauſe all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, both of wiſdome, and knowledge, being hid in him, it was impoſſible, for him to have any miſapprehenſion; He conceived rightly of all things, and ſpake truly of all, even his enemies being witneſſes. Hear what they ſay, Matth. 20. 16. <hi>They ſent out to him their Diſciples, with the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Take <hi>Truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in oppoſition to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. As oppoſed to Lying.</note> 
                     <hi>Lie not one to another,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians; but ſpeak the truth, every man to his neighbour.</hi> So Chriſt was, <hi>full of truth.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> telleth you, <hi>That he was a Lamb, without ſpot, or blemiſh, he did no ſin,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 22. <hi>He did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</hi> It might be ſought for, but was not found. The word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, it was not found in his mouth: for many lay at catch for Chriſt, if they could have trap't him in his ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; There was a great deal of watching, but no guile found in his Lips. He did neither <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:168769:126"/> A prudent man will be carefull not to tell a lie, nor yet to ſpeak, what is untrue; One that will not lie, may yet poſſibly ſpeak an untruth, but Chriſt did never ſo much, as ſpeak an untruth. He was ſo far from <hi>Lying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If ye take <hi>Truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in oppoſition <note place="margin">4. As oppoſed to Shadowes.</note> to <hi>Shadowes,</hi> Hebr. 9. 24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the Holy place made with hands, which are the figures of the true,</hi> &amp;c. Here is <hi>true,</hi> oppoſed to <hi>figure,</hi> to <hi>ſhadow.</hi> In this ſenſe, Chriſt is, <hi>full of Truth;</hi> becauſe he is the ſubſtance of all thoſe <hi>ſhadowes,</hi> which were under the old Law: which ſome take to be the ſenſe of what followeth, Joh. 1. 17. <hi>The Law came by Moſes, but faith, and truth, by Jeſus Chriſt. Truth</hi> is here oppoſed to the <hi>Ceremoniall Law,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> as <hi>grace</hi> to the <hi>Morall;</hi> Let us learn ſomething throughout every branch of this Explication.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seeing Chriſt is <hi>full of grace,</hi> in an active ſenſe, <label type="milestone">

But look at him in the glaſſe of the Goſpell, that holdeth him forth, <hi>full of grace.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that proceedeth from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> telleth you what he is; He came down in the ſhape of a Lamb, to ſhew the meekneſſe of Chriſt. The Diſciples they ſaw him, as <hi>full of grace.</hi> The friends of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſaw him, <hi>weep over Lazarus.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Behold how he loved him;</hi> the ſame bowels Chriſt hath now in Heaven, as he had upon the Earth. And if it were poſſible, that they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of inlargement, there are none more large; now all the proviſion is laid in, and the meat bought, and the Table ſpread, and diſhes provided. What doth God expect, but that the people ſhould fall to, and eate? How can we doubt of his good will now, that hath done, and ſuffered, and prepared ſo much for us? It is not now to do, it is done already; therefore we may be ſurer of his good-will, than they, before the price was paid.</p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:168769:127"/>
                  <p> Secondly, Seeing Chriſt is <hi>full of grace,</hi> even in regard <note place="margin">2. To look at Beauty as a bleſſing.</note> of his body Look at Beauty as a bleſſing. This kind of grace is one of the things that adorned Chriſt. I ſay, look at beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a bleſſing, when it falleth upon a body, joyned to ſuch a ſoul as Chriſt's was; otherwiſe, it is to the ſoul as a ruſty ſword in a velver ſcabbard. The beauty of a prophane perſon is but like the ſhining of a rotten ſtick, like the gayneſſe of thoſe weeds in your corn-fields, that make a fair ſhew, yet, if you touch them, they are offenſive, not to be endured. There can no expreſſion equall the foulneſſe of them in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, Prov. 11. 22. <hi>as a jewel of gold in a ſwine's ſnout, ſo is a fair woman without diſcretion.</hi> But now, where there is a meeting of the inward graces of the ſoul, and this outward gracefulneſſe in the body, there beauty is an ornament. <hi>Pulchior eſt virtus veniens è corp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re pulcro.</hi> Where beauty and godlineſſe be, there grace is more beautifull, in ſuch a body, in ſuch a perſon. And the beauty is more gracefull, where there is grace to ſet it out, where the inſide is adorned as well as the outſide. It is an high commendation that the Scripture giveth of <hi>Abigail,</hi> and ſheweth what beauty is moſt deſirable; a ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was found in her, <hi>A beautifull woman, of a good underſtanding,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 3. <hi>The name of his wife was Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail, and ſhe was a woman of a good underſtanding, and of a beautifull countenance.</hi> Such as God hath beſtowed beauty upon, ſhould be carefull not to blemiſh it, by any untoward converſation; but to be looking to God both inſide and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. When ye have good apparell on, ye are loath to ſtain that; When God hath apparelled your beauty with beauty, take heed of ſtaining that by any uncleanneſſe whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And, in the next place, in that Chriſt was full of grace <note place="margin">3. To learn to have recourſe to Chriſt, when we ſtand in need of grace.</note> in regard of the ſoul; We ſhould learn from hence, whom to have recourſe to, when we ſtand in need of grace, even to this full Fountain; for he received it, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it. He was filled with an over-flowing fulneſſe, that <hi>of his fulneſſe we might receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. Chriſt is full of grace, as a woman's breaſt is full of milk, that even aketh for want of being drawn. Chriſt, as he is full, ſo he delighteth to communicate of his fulneſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168769:127"/> it is an eaſe to him to be drawn. Of this, we ſhall ſpeak, God-willing, in its place.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt is <hi>full of grace,</hi> of grace that fell upon <note place="margin">4. To learn, whence all our acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cometh.</note> his whole Perſon; that is, <hi>Full of acceptation with God,</hi> a gratious receiving into favour with God the Father. And this letteth us ſee, whence we are to fetch all our accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How it commeth to paſſe, that the Saints come to be ſo gratious with God? Why, in and through Chriſt, who is <hi>full of grace</hi> and <hi>acceptance; They are accepted</hi> (as ye heard before) <hi>in the beloved.</hi> Chriſt is ſo gratious, as to ingratiate all that believe in him. He is God's <hi>Favourite,</hi> and bringeth into favour all ſuch as are allotted to him.

                     <hi>Jacob</hi> took that courſe, ſo muſt we, if we will have a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> told the <hi>Patriarks, They ſhould</hi>

                     <hi>not ſee his face, except they brought their younger brother Benjamin along with them;</hi> ſo there is no ſeeing of the face of God, unleſſe we bring Chriſt along with us in the arms of our faith. There is a ſtory, Act. 12. of the men of <hi>Tyre,</hi> when <hi>Herod</hi> was diſpleaſed with them, how they made uſe of <hi>Blaſtus</hi> the King's <hi>Chamberlain;</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>And Herod was in diſpleaſure with them of Tyre and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>don; but they came with one accord to him: and having made Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus the King's Chamberlain their friend, deſired peace, becauſe their country was nouriſhed by the King's country.</hi> This is our caſe. God is highly diſpleaſed with us for our ſins, as <hi>Herod</hi> was with the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon;</hi> we have our dependency upon God, as they had upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s country, <hi>Their country was nouriſhed by the King's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> We are undone, if God relieve us not. Now they are undone; the beſt way is, to make <hi>Blaſtus</hi> their friend, that ſo <hi>Herod</hi> being appeaſed, they may have peace. We are to go to God by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that we may have acceptation with God. He is full of grace, and they ſhall partake of his grace and favour; even as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when he was got in with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he made way for all his brethren: the Text ſaith, Gen. 47. 2. <hi>He took ſome of his brethren, and preſented them to Pharaoh.</hi> Juſt ſo doth Chriſt take us, and preſents us to God. The <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> hath a phraſe ſomewhat like
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168769:128"/> it, where he ſaith, 2 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that he might take us by the hand, and lead us to God. Now theſe men being preſented by <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſee how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> entertaineth them, <hi>See, the land is before thee; in the beſt of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell.</hi> If Chriſt hath once brought us to God, not onely all the good things of the world, but all the promiſes of the Word, are before a Saint, when he is brought to God by grace, and ſo ingratiated with him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Seeing Chriſt is <hi>full of truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in <note place="margin">5. Learn to be like Chriſt.</note> oppoſition to <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> learn we to be like him; it is good being of Chriſt's faſhion. The girdle of his loins is <hi>Truth,</hi> as ye heard before out of verſe 11. Let it be the girdle of ours, <hi>Having your loins girt about with truth.</hi> Be ſincere in all we ſpeak and do; otherwiſe, all our performances, be they never ſo glorious, they are but like a fair pair of gilded Organs, that want wind or bellowes to blow them; ſo are all our performances, if there be no ſincerity to enliven them. All outward ſervices, they are but the carcaſes of Devotion, if there want ſincerity. Epheſ. 4. 24. It is called, <hi>The new man, created in righteouſneſſe, and in the holineſs of the truth,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſo it is in the Originall; it is, <hi>a holineſſe of truth.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, no holineſſe at all, if truth be not there.</p>
                  <p>Again, If Chriſt be thus <hi>full of truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in <note place="margin">2. To go to him for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> oppoſition to <hi>errour;</hi> then we may ſee from hence, whom to go to for guidance in all matters of opinion; to Him that is <hi>full of truth,</hi> that cannot erre. <hi>Doceat me Deus qui me fecit, &amp; non qui ſeipſum ignorat.</hi> Let him teach me that made me; let not him teach me that knoweth not himſelf. Every man is a lover of his own opinion, and apt to miſcary; but it is Chriſt that is <hi>ful of truth, who hath promiſed to guide us by his ſpirit, and to lead us into all truth,</hi> Joh. 16. 13.</p>
                  <p>Again, If Chriſt be <hi>full of truth,</hi> as it ſtandeth in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <note place="margin">3. Matter of comfort to the people of God,</note> to <hi>lying:</hi> Let us learn from hence to gather matter of <hi>comfort</hi> to all the people of God. <hi>He that is full of truth, and cannot lie,</hi> hath ſaid to every poor ſoul, <hi>Come to me ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. If any man</hi>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:168769:128"/> 
                     <hi>come to me, I will in no wiſe caſt him off.</hi> So is it matter of <note place="margin">and of terrour to the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
                     <hi>terrour</hi> to all ungodly impenitent ſinners. <hi>He that believeth not, is damned already. He that believeth, ſhall be ſaved; he that believeth not is damned, the wrath of God abideth upon him.</hi> And ſo matter of <hi>Imitation</hi> for all. If our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> whom we profeſſe our ſelves to depend upon, and to <note place="margin">Matter of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation for all.</note> be <hi>Diſciples</hi> of, be full of <hi>truth,</hi> let us be like him. Therein ſtandeth the true Religion, in imitating him whom we worſhip, ſaith <hi>Lactantius. If people be given to lying, they are more like the devill than Chriſt:</hi> For it is ſaid of ſuch, <hi>Ye are of your father the devill.</hi> He is a liar, and the father of it. Mark, he ſpeaks of his own when he ſpeaks a lie. Now there will be a time, when every ſoul ſhall be ranſackt. Take heed, leſt the devill find ſomething of his own, reigning in you. It is ſaid, he came to Chriſt, <hi>The Prince of this world commeth,</hi> Joh. 14. 13. <hi>and hath nothing in me;</hi> that is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his own in me. He came and ſearched Chriſt, but found nothing of his there. Take heed, leſt when he comes to you, he find a <hi>lying ſpirit</hi> there, that is his own. As, when <hi>Laban</hi> came to ſearch <hi>Jacob</hi>'s tent, to try if he could find any of his own goods there; if he had, it would have gone ill with <hi>Jacob:</hi> As, when ſearchers come to a ſhip, and find any prohibited goods there, the owner forfeits all the lading. If the devill come, and find any thing of his own, he takes that ſoul to hell. <hi>Without are dogs, and every one that loves and makes a lie,</hi> Rev. 22. 15.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Seeing Chriſt is <hi>full of truth,</hi> as it ſtands in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>ſhadowes:</hi> Let us learn to embrace him, that ſo we may find the <hi>ſubſtance.</hi> That is the phraſe of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> Prov. 8. 21. where Wiſdom ſpeaks thus, <hi>That I may cauſe thoſe that love me to inherit ſubſtance, and I will fill them with treaſures.</hi> Chriſt is not onely the ſubſtance of all <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall ſhadowes,</hi> (they are vaniſhed, we have now nothing to do with them); but there is another ſort of <hi>ſhadowes</hi> that men doat upon, more than the <hi>Jewes</hi> upon their <hi>ceremoniall carnall things,</hi> delights of the world, riches, pleaſures, and profits; there are ſome men that buſie themſelves in theſe. What ſaith the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> of them? Pſal. 83. 17. <hi>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to</hi>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:168769:129"/> 
                     <hi>ſhame and periſh.</hi> All are but <hi>ſhadowes,</hi> in compariſon, no reality. Oh then, he is a ſubſtantiall man that inherits, he that leaveth to follow after <hi>ſhadowes</hi> to inherit Chriſt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, all men that buſie themſelves in things below, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Chriſt, they are but like a man that goes into an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and, inſtead of pulling the fruit, he catcheth at the ſhadow of the fruit, that are ſcattered in the hedge; he hurts himſelf, and getteth not the fruit. Would ye have Chriſt, ye muſt go to God for him; the reality of all is founded in him. What are the things men doat upon? but either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or riches, or pleaſures, the worlds Trinity, as ſome call thoſe three: We ſhall find them all in Chriſt, Prov. 3. 16, 17. where Wiſdom ſpeaks thus (that Wiſdom is Chriſt) <hi>In her right hand are riches and honour. Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſſe.</hi> Here is all three, riches, honour, and pleaſure; and all found in <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, The matter of his teſtimony here, <hi>He that commeth after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt. The <hi>Witneſſe-bearer</hi> was
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168769:129"/> 
                  <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> of whom we read, verſ. 7. that <hi>he came</hi>

               <p>This was his Office, and ye find him taken up in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it, and ſo ſhould every one be; <hi>For we muſt walk Circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe,</hi> not to forget the errand we are ſent about. Every bleſſed man is like <hi>that Tree,</hi> Pſal. 1. <hi>that bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon;</hi> which is proper to his Calling, and in ſuch a time, as is moſt proper for that fruit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. Ye have an <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall</hi> Injunction. <hi>Let him that hath a Miniſtry, wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his miniſtry; or he that exhorts upon his exhortation; He that giveth, let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that ſheweth mercy, with Cheerfulneſſe.</hi> Men loſe nothing, by being imployed in that ſervice, that <note place="margin">Nothing loſt by diligence in God's ſervice.</note> God cals them to; and men get nothing, by being buſie in other men's matters. One may be over-buſie, and yet, in God's account, but an idle perſon, if he doth not his proper work, 1 Tim. 5. 13. <hi>And withall, they learn to be Idle, wandring about from houſe to houſe; and not onely idle, but Tatlers alſo, and buſie-bodies, ſpeaking things which they ought not.</hi> Buſie bodies, and yet idle: Why? why, becauſe buſie in matters that concern them not.</p>
               <p>The next is the manner of <hi>John's</hi> witneſſe bearing, <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe-bearing.</note> 
                  <hi>bare witneſſe, and cried;</hi> The Baptiſt cried in his witneſſing of Chriſt. There is ſomething remarkable in that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Scripture contents it ſelfe in other Caſes, to ſay, <hi>He opened his mouth, and ſpake;</hi> here <hi>John,</hi> Crieth. What is the myſtery of this? He is ſaid to cry for ſome one, or all (perhaps) of theſe three Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reference to a fore-going Prophecy; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:168769:130"/> 
                  <hi>Crier;</hi> therefore; this voice is applied to him.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly, In reference to the time, when he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <note place="margin">2. To the time of his witneſſing.</note> to witneſſe of Chriſt, and that was, as <hi>Philogus</hi> telleth us, in the year of <hi>Jubilee;</hi> under the Law, every fiftieth year, the Jewes were to keep a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> wherein they were to ordain liberty to their ſervants, and reſtore men to their poſſeſſions, that had been mortgaged, Levit. 25. 9, 10. <hi>Then ſhalt thou cauſe the Trumpet of the Jubilee, to ſound in the tenth day of the ſeventh month; in the day of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, ſhall ye make the Trumpet ſound through all your Land, unto all the Inhabitants thereof. It ſhall be a Jubilee unto you, and ye ſhall return every man to his poſſeſſion, and ye ſhall return every man unto his family. John,</hi> that came to be the Miniſter of the Goſpell, he began in a year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> becauſe he was to proclaime a liberty, that came by Chriſt; who was now to be exhibited, and to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe he came, by the Miniſtry of the <hi>Goſpell</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore men to thoſe poſſeſſions they had loſt in <hi>Adam, even to an Eternall Inheritance, reſerved in Heaven for them.</hi> The year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> was to be proclaimed by a <hi>Trumpet;</hi> Therefore, <hi>John comes crying.</hi> The Interpretation, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a ſtrong confirmation of that, Iſaiah 58. 1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice, like a Trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſions, and the houſe of Iſrael their ſins.</hi> Here <hi>John's</hi> voice cometh, as a <hi>Jubilee-Trumpet,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim liberty to them that were Captive; therefore, he is ſaid, to <hi>Cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Crying may referre to the temper of his ſpirit, <note place="margin">3. To the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity in his witneſſe-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Exod. 14. 15.</note> in his witneſſe-bearing to Chriſt; you may note his fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, or alacrity, or both. <hi>Crying</hi> noteth <hi>fervency, Why Crieſt thou to me, ſaith God to Moſes at the Red Sea,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was moſt fervent in ſpirit; yet we read of nothing he ſaid, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine. The people cried, and God heard them not, Moſes held his peace, and yet was heard, becauſe there was a louder cry within.</hi> Of Chriſt himſelfe it is ſaid, In the daies of his fleſh, <hi>He offered up Prayers with ſtrong cries, and tears. The ſpirit crieth Abba, Father.</hi> It is a term of earneſtneſſe, and ſo of <hi>alacrity</hi> too, Hoſ. 12. ult. <hi>Cry out, and ſhout thou inhabitant of Sion, for great is the</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:168769:130"/> 
                  <hi>Holy one of Iſrael, in the midſt of thee; John</hi> went about this work, with a great deal of earneſtneſſe, and delight. He that leapt in his Mother's Womb, when the newes came <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 41.</note> of the Conception of Chriſt; now he leapeth with much more joy, when he himſelfe came to be the <hi>proclaimer</hi> of Chriſt. He himſelfe hath the honour to be the <hi>Day-Star,</hi> that ſhall uſher-in the Sun of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> to be more then a <hi>Prophet;</hi> He pointed at him with the finger, and ſaid, <hi>This is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> Let us all learn from hence, to cry up Chriſt in our ſeverall places, and according to our ſeverall capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; <hi>John</hi> did ſo, when he witneſſed of him, to cry up Chriſt with all the <hi>alacrity,</hi> and <hi>fervency,</hi> that may be. You know how <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and the <hi>Silver-Smiths,</hi> cried<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up <note place="margin">Act. 19. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Diana,</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> becauſe they got their Living by making of her Silver-ſhrines. The merits of Chriſt will bring us more, than the ſhrines of <hi>Diana</hi> can bring to them; We ſhall have Life, and Life Eternall, with this Life. Therefore, we have more cauſe to cry up, <hi>Great is the Lord Jeſus; Great is the Lord, the Rock of our Salvation, and our Righteouſneſſe.</hi> And the rather, becauſe in few words, the beſt way in the World, to cry down both ſin, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is, to cry up Chriſt. <hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> both, will fall like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the <hi>Ark,</hi> if Chriſt were once up in men's hearts.</p>
               <p>There is uſe, of other Arguments and Conſiderations, as of the Law, and the terrour of the day of Judgement, and torments of Hell, theſe have their place; There is nothing ſo effectuall to draw ſinners out of hell, as the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Chriſt; when they know Chriſt is Crucified, they then are crucified with Chriſt. A man may be terrified with the threats of the Law, and thoughts of iudgement to come, and yet have an heart filled with luſt all this while; If Chriſt once come into the heart, he driveth out theſe luſts before him: The like may be ſaid of <hi>Errors, Corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi> If the Sun of <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> comes in, it is his beams that cauſeth all theſe ſhadowes to fly away; nothing ſo ſoon, nothing ſo ſure. Inſtance, in Popery. There may be great uſe of preaching, againſt the particular points of it; againſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:168769:131"/> 
                  <hi>Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and <hi>Worſhipping of images.</hi> But if once a man could ſet up Chriſt in his heart, How ſoon would theſe vaniſh? Saith <hi>Calvin, Popery</hi> cannot ſtand, but where the <hi>ignorance of Chriſt</hi> is brought in; for the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh <hi>Popery</hi> to fall. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> are like two buckets in a Well; if the one goeth up, the other goeth down. <hi>Popery</hi> cannot thrive in that ſoyl, where Chriſt is planted. Thus much from theſe words, the manner of his bearing witneſſe, <hi>He came crying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the Time; that, I told you, lay in theſe <note place="margin">3. The time when he did bear witneſſe.</note> words, <hi>This was he of whom I ſpake.</hi> Whence it is gathered, That <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> having teſtified of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he came to his Baptiſm, continued his bearing witneſſe to him, <hi>now, when Jeſus was gone into the wilderneſſe;</hi> which, ye know, was preſently after he was baptized. That difference is between this <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> and the former; he relateth what they omitted, and omitteth many of thoſe things, that they relate. The <hi>other</hi> had ſpoken of the teſtimony that <hi>John</hi> gave to Chriſt, before he made himſelf known; our <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſpeaketh nothing of this, but falleth upon thoſe Teſtimonies which he gave to Chriſt, after he was made known. Now he was made known at his baptiſm, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. Chemnitius</hi> maketh it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plainly, that what <hi>John</hi> ſaith in my Text, was ſpoken after Chriſt was baptized, when he was drawn aſide into the wilderneſſe, to be tempted of the Devill. <hi>I ſaid, This was he; yet he came after me, and was before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve from hence this, namely, <hi>That the Baptiſt was honouring Chriſt, when the devill was tempting of him</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                  </label> While Satan was uſing all his ſubtlery, to overcome Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, <hi>John</hi> is uſing all his earneſtneſſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cry him up, to exalt him in the hearts of his hearers. This is a ſpeciall piece of Chriſtian prudence, for men to counterwork the devill; to appear ſo much the more for Chriſt, by how much the more Satan and his inſtruments appear againſt him. There ſhould be a kind of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> in the ſoul of every believer; as in the fire, that burns hotteſt then, when the aire round about it, is coldeſt. The middle Region is therefore coldeſt, becauſe the great heat of each,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:168769:131"/> takes the reflection from the lower and the upper heat above. Such an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> ſhould be found in Chriſtians, they ſhould be witneſſes in the deadeſt times, and their hearts ſhould be ſofteſt in the hardeſt times, and fulleſt of activity for Chriſt, in the times of the greateſt oppoſition againſt him. As <hi>John</hi> is a honouring of him, when the Devill is a tempting him. The reaſon lyeth in that enmity, which was put at firſt between the Serpent, and the Seed of the woman; for enmities work one againſt another, contraries expell one another. The Devill will be ſure to croſſe us if he can, when we go to any ſpirituall duty; as, When the <hi>high Prieſt Zachary was ſtanding before the Lord,</hi> then it is ſaid, <hi>There was Satan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him,</hi> Zach. 3. 1. Therefore when we ſee Satan plotting any miſchief, we ſhould ſtand at his right hand to reſiſt him. We ſhould do what we can for Chriſt, at ſuch times more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially. Then our ſervice is moſt acceptable, and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For men not to be aſhamed of Chriſt, in the midſt of a crooked and an adulterous generation; yet, for men to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for Chriſt, in a back-ſliding generation, run through the ſtories of all times, and ye ſhall find, this hath been the ſpirit of the Saints. When <hi>Herod</hi> ſought for Chriſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 14.</note> him in his Infancy, then was <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> moſt carefull of him, and took him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> When the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">When Chriſt is moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, then we ſhould moſt appear for Him.</note> and <hi>Levites,</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> did much oppoſe him in his Members; then the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> moſt of all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, and tell the Rulers to their faces, <hi>Whether it be better to obey God or man, judge ye.</hi> In the Primitive times, when it was death to bear the name of a Chriſtian, then did <hi>Pauſanius,</hi> when they asked him what he was, ſay, <hi>My name is Chriſtian, and my ſirname is Catholick.</hi> His name was <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and thoſe that oppoſed Chriſtianity. I need not tell you of our <hi>Worthies</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s daies, that not onely by their Writings, but by their Sufferings, witneſſed for Chriſt, not onely in black and white, but in red too. It ſhould be ſo ſtill; the very thoughts of their flames ſhould kindle zeal in us. Chriſt is oppoſed even at this day, in many waies, therefore we ſhould ſtrive for him. There are many <hi>tempters</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:168769:132"/> and <hi>revilers</hi> now, therefore Chriſt ſhould have many <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions</hi> now. Heaven and Earth may both teach us this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Time was, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> came to the men of <hi>Bethlehem, He came to his own, and his own received him not;</hi> they refuſed to entertain <hi>Chriſt</hi> as became him. Then doth the Star from heaven own him, that comes, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">Matth. 2. 9.</note> the Wiſe-men where he was, and ſtandeth before the houſe. Afterwards, when his own rejected him, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas,</hi> ſaid they; When the Jewes that pronounced <note place="margin">Joh. 18. 40.</note> him not worthy to live, had got their ends, then the Sun is darkned, and the Earth quaked; they owned their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maker</hi> then, when the Jewes refuſed him.

                     <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and the diſcharge of that.

And, in the Scripture-phraſe, the followers of any <hi>Teacher,</hi> it is uſually ſaid of them, that <hi>they go after ſuch a one;</hi> becauſe the <hi>Teacher</hi> was wont to go before, and the <hi>Diſciples</hi> after, which is the proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the phraſe in that place, Matth. 16. 24. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to his diſciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſſe, and follow me.</hi> The <hi>Diſciple</hi> is ſaid to come after, and to follow the <hi>Teacher. Chriſt</hi> here to come after <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he was one of his <hi>Hearers.</hi> Go we on to the next words.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>He that comes after me, is preferred before me.</head>
                  <p>Namely, <hi>In regard of his worth and dignity.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chriſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before <hi>John,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his worth and dignity.</note> comes after the <hi>Harbinger,</hi> and yet is preferred before him.

Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Harbinger; Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Morning-ſtar; Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Voice.</hi> Though he comes after me, he was before me. And it is reaſon he ſhould be preferred before him in <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> becauſe he was before him in regard of his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> as being <hi>God from everlaſting to everlaſting, whoſe going forth is from all eternity.</hi> He was not onely before <hi>John,</hi> but before <hi>Abraham;</hi> Joh. 8. 58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, yea, before the <hi>World</hi> was. Prov. 8. 25, 26. <hi>Before the mountains were ſetled, or before the hills were brought forth; while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields, nor the higheſt part of the duſt of the world.</hi> Ye have <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> telling us in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſ. 34. that he bears witneſſe to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Chriſt; <hi>And I ſaw, and bear record, that this is the Son of God.</hi> Now this he doth in this place, He proveth, and bears record, that Chriſt is the <hi>Son</hi> of God, becauſe he was before all. That is a teſtimony of his <hi>Divinity.</hi> The ſum of all then is this, <hi>John's endeavour is, to preferre Chriſt before him;</hi> that is the thing I would have you to obſerve. And it ſhould
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:168769:133"/> be the care of every Believer, to prefer and exalt, and ſet up Chriſt above himſelf. <hi>He that came after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> was put upon this, becauſe the people had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of him, that he was the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and therefore he made it his buſineſſe throughly to depreſſe himſelf, to exalt his <hi>Saviour. I muſt decreaſe, but he muſt encreaſe. I am the friend of the Bridegroom, but he is the Bridegroom that hath the Bride. I baptize with water, but he with the holy. Ghoſt.</hi> I am the pooreſt ſinner, but <hi>he is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> It was the ſcope of his Miniſtry, to prefer <hi>Chriſt</hi> before <hi>himſelf,</hi> whom the people were apt to magnifie. And ſo <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 3. 12, 13, 14. ſaid, <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, why marvail ye at this, or why look ye ſo earneſtly upon us, as though by our own power or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jeſus; whom ye delivered up, and denied in the preſence of Pilat, when he was determined to let him go. But ye denied the holy One, and the Juſt, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto you.</hi> The four and twenty <hi>Elders,</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ye find them caſting down their Crowns at the feet of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and giving all praiſe to him; Rev. 4. 10, 11. <hi>The four and twenty Elders fell down before him that ſate upon the throne, and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever; and caſt their crowns before the throne, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive honour, and glory, and power; for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more to blame are they (to make ſome Uſe of this, before I end) that either in point of Salvation, or Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſcribe more to <hi>themſelves</hi> than to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> inſtead of preferring <hi>Chriſt</hi> before <hi>them,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> did. This Reproof may concern a great many of us, and, haply, more, than are well aware of it. For this is truth, that <hi>Spanhemius</hi> lately ſaid, in one of his Treatiſes, <hi>Naturaliter aliquid</hi> Pelagii, <hi>&amp; aliquid</hi> Phariſaei <hi>in nobis habemus;</hi> We have all by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſomething of the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and ſomething of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee</hi> in us. <hi>Pelagian-like,</hi> we are all apt to aſcribe too much
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168769:134"/> to our own <hi>free-will;</hi> and, <hi>Phariſee-like,</hi> we are all apt to aſcribe to our ſelves <hi>the merits of our good works.</hi> What men are thoſe that maintain, that God hath given them a power to will, but the act of willing they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Is not this to aſcribe more to themſelves, than to God? Is it not more, actually to will what is good, than to have a power to will it. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> profeſſeth himſelf, once of opinion, That men were able of themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Goſpell, when it was preached; but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from that errour, by that place of the <hi>Apoſtle, What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> And, <hi>O man, who hath made thee to differ?</hi> And yet a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> of late hath dared to ſay, <hi>I have made my ſelf to differ from others.</hi> Though God gives me power to will, yet to will is of my ſelf. Here is ſomething of the <hi>Pelagian.</hi> See now ſomething of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> in thoſe that pride themſelves for their good works, with the neglect of Chriſt. Ye know what the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> do, they aſcribe ſomething to their merits. They will give ſomething to Chriſt in the beginning, but the carrying on of their works they will have to themſelves. Which <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> againſt <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith: A father beſtoweth a Farm upon his ſon; the ſon, by his improvement of this Farm, groweth ſo rich, as he is able to make the purchaſe of a greater Farm; which he hath not from his father, but hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it by his own induſtry, and improvement of the ſtock which his father gave him. So, God doth at firſt beſtow a ſtock of grace upon us, ſaith he; but we, by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this grace, are able to purchaſe ſomething at God's hands. Who is the <hi>Purchaſer?</hi> whether he that layeth out the mony for what is bought, or he that gave the firſt Farm? So, Who is the <hi>Procurer</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> whether Chriſt that giveth the firſt grace, or the man that hath ſo improved that grace, as to purchaſe Heaven at the hands of God? All theſe things are aſcribed to the next cauſe, not to the remore cauſe. Chriſt is the remote cauſe of ſalvation, but the man himſelf is the next cauſe of his own ſalvation and happineſs. Here the <hi>man</hi> is preferred before <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And have we not many amongſt our ſelves? Ask them, How they hope to be ſaved? Whereas there is no true anſwer in the world, but
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168769:134"/> this, <hi>Chriſt in you, the hope of glory.</hi> Chriſt in me, is my hope to be ſaved: Yet their common anſwer is, They hope to be ſaved by their prayers, and duties, and good meaning, and good endeavours. What is this, but to ſet a <hi>man's ſelf</hi> above <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to look for ſalvation by his own <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,</hi> and not by the merits of his <hi>Saviour.</hi> Men may ſometimes have Chriſt in their mouthes, but look what their hearts run to when they think of ſalvation, that many times is their own works. It is a good ſaying of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> in a Latine Treatiſe of his, <hi>Nemo magnus eſt operando, quin Chriſtus; &amp; qui mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt, magnus eſt per fidem in illo:</hi> There is none great in works but Chriſt; and if we will be great, it muſt be by faith in him. Others, perhaps, will give you a better anſwer, to ſeem to; yet, in the iſſue, it commeth much to one: They tell you, They come to ſalvation by believing in Chriſt. But ask them, how they come to believe? Why, becauſe they find ſo much humiliation in their hearts, and dependency upon Chriſt. Here a man ſetteth up belief, whereas in the true courſe of things, good works ſhould be made out by the iſſue of faith. Here is a kind of baſtard-faith, made out as <note place="margin">Faith to be manifeſted by works.</note> the iſſue of good works. Certainly, good works may help faith. Faith groweth fat and well-liking, the more it putteth forth it ſelf in works of holineſſe. But it is faith laying hold upon Chriſt, that bringeth in all our comfort. Therefore he that will go the other way to work, muſt ſettle himſelf on Chriſt by faith. <hi>He that was mighty in Peter to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, was mighty in me to the uncircumciſion. Chriſt</hi> was mighty in <hi>Paul,</hi> and mighty in <hi>Peter,</hi> they had great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in their miniſtry; but, Whom do they thank for it? <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not themſelves. As <hi>Joab</hi> did, when they had taken <hi>Rabbah,</hi> 2. Sam. 12. 27. <hi>He ſent meſſengers to David, ſaying, I have fought againſt Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. Now therefore gather the reſt of the people together, and encamp againſt the City, and take it; leſt I take the City, and it be called by my name. Joab</hi> had taken a great deal of pains in the ſervice, but he would have his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>David</hi> to have all the honour. So, whatſoever pains a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or any other, hath taken in the work of God; he
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:168769:135"/> muſt take heed of ſetting up himſelf: now caſt in for Chriſt, let him have all the praiſe. There is a <hi>Rabbah</hi> taken, when a man is converted, a fort taken out of the <hi>Devills</hi> hands; who ſhall have the praiſe, the <hi>Miniſter?</hi> no, but the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that giveth the ſucceſſe. <hi>Joab</hi> he fought, and took the City, but <hi>Joab</hi> was <hi>David's</hi> ſervant, therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> muſt have the praiſe; All the ability, and grace, that thou haſt laid out in this ſervice, they are <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> therefore not to be aſcribed to thee. Thou canſt not go one ſtep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes in to thy aſſiſtance; <hi>Joab</hi> bringeth the work to perfection, and yet <hi>David</hi> abſent a great way off. The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is alwayes preſent, with any that do a good work; therefore, all the praiſe is to be given to him. When <hi>Peter</hi> drew up the multitude of fiſh, doth he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his owne Net? no, but he giveth the glory of it to the Lord Chriſt; though it was <hi>Peters</hi> net, and <hi>Peters</hi> hand that drew up the net, yet it was not <hi>Peters</hi> ſtrength. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, give to the Lord all the praiſe, that ſo we may preferre <hi>Chriſt</hi> before all, as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did.</p>

                  <hi>For of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi> Onely there is a great doubt, and Controverſie, amongſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters;</hi> whether theſe be the words of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> or of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some think them to be a continuation of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt's</hi> Teſtimony, which I diſcourſed to you of, out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe? <hi>This was he, of whom I ſpake, He that comes after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others think, they are the words of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and cohere with thoſe words, in the end of the fourteenth verſe, <hi>Full of Grace, and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:168769:135"/>
               <p> And I rather joyne with them. Partly, for that reaſon, and partly, becauſe that the graces of Chriſt, which he ſpeaks of here, and in the following verſe, <hi>The Law came by Moſes, but grace and truth by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were not ſo fully manifeſted, when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſpake, as when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> wrote this <hi>Goſpell.</hi> For the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to the ſhadowes of it, were then expired; The truth of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was then exhibited, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> come down, and aboundance of grace ſhed abroad all the World over. So that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> may well ſay, <hi>Of his fulneſſe we have all received, The Law came by Moſes;</hi> and now, <hi>grace and truth, is come by Jeſus.</hi> It was ſo, (when the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> wrote) in the full exhibition of it.</p>
               <p>The matter in difference is not very great. But let us take them, as to the Coherence, and then for the parts.</p>
               <p>You have in this ſhort verſe, aboundance of particulars. The generall parts, they are but two, But the latter is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Here is a ſtore-houſe, an Heavenly ſtore-houſe of Treaſure, that is, <hi>the fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. Of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The improvement hereof, for the chiefeſt good of it; <hi>We have all received, even grace for grace.</hi> And in this, four particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The perſons, <hi>All we.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The participation, <hi>Have received.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The proportion, not his fulneſſe, But, <hi>of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; de plenitudine,</hi> and not <hi>plenitudinem,</hi> ſome ſhare of his fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The treaſure it ſelfe, which was imparted, that is, <hi>Grace for grace. Of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi>
               </p>

                  <p>There is an aboundant fulneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt, of whom it is ſaid, Col. 2. 19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, in him ſhould</hi>

                     <hi>all fulneſſe dwell. All fulneſſe, All</hi> for kind, and <hi>All</hi> for degree.</p>
                  <p>And it, therefore, pleaſed the Father, That all fulneſſe ſhould dwell in him, becauſe he was to be the <hi>head</hi> of the <note place="margin">All fulneſſe in Chriſt, as the head of the body.</note> 
                     <hi>body;</hi> He is the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> the <hi>Church, for it pleaſed the Father, That in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be full of all grace, becauſe he was to be the <hi>head</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> As in the naturall body, becauſe the head is to convey ſenſe to all the body, therefore, all the <hi>Organs</hi> of ſenſe are placed in the head. The <hi>eye</hi> whereby we ſee, and the <hi>ear</hi> whereby we hear, and the <hi>noſe</hi> by which we ſmell, the <hi>palate</hi> by which we taſt; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is to be the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore, all fulneſſe was to be in him; He was to be an <hi>univerſall Cauſe,</hi> which was to have an <hi>univerſall Influence,</hi> therefore, there muſt needs be in him an <hi>univerſall fulneſſe.</hi> As in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> there was a <hi>fulneſſe of human nature,</hi> and <hi>of righteouſneſſe too,</hi> as long as he ſtood; becauſe he was to convey the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, together with the Image of God, to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if he had continued. So in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> There was to be <hi>a fulneſſe of grace,</hi> becauſe he was to convey all grace to all believers, to the end of the World. <hi>Joſeph</hi> fill'd the <hi>Granaries</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> with Corn; Why? Becauſe not onely <hi>Egypt,</hi> but all the Countries there about, were to be ſuppli'd with Corn in time of Famine. So it pleaſed God, that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, That <hi>all, Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> might come to him for grace; <hi>All</hi> muſt go through the hands of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to the people: Even as the Liver is full of blood, becauſe it conveyeth blood to the members of the body. The Sea is full of water, becauſe it conveyeth water to all the Rivers; And the Sun full of light, becauſe it conveyeth light to all the Stars. So Chriſt is full of grace, becauſe He was to be the Conveyer of grace.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak a little more diſtinctly. There is a threefold ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt. <note place="margin">A threefold fulneſſe in Chriſt.</note>

                  <p> See the diſtinction, and difference between them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is in Chriſt, <hi>A fulneſſe of Divinity,</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">1. A fulneſſe of Divinity.</note> commonly, it is ſaid, Col. 2. 9. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> There are to be found in others, <hi>gifts,</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> that flow from the <hi>Godhead;</hi> Theſe were in <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>all Saints.</hi> But the <hi>Godhead</hi> it ſelfe, is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And that, not according to ſome portion of it; as the <hi>Heathens</hi> had a conceit, that the Divinity was diſperſed, and ſcattered. That one had one part of it, and another, another part. And therefore, they made many ſorts of <hi>Gods,</hi> becauſe they thought no one ſufficient to contain the whole <hi>Deity;</hi> therefore, they made <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the reſt, to have their ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. But here is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not the <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> but the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Godhead; In him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fullneſſe of the Godhead bodily.</hi> Not a parcell, but <hi>all</hi> and <hi>bodily,</hi> that is, either <hi>really.</hi> If ye take <hi>body,</hi> as it ſtandeth in oppoſition to <hi>ſhadowes,</hi> and <hi>figures;</hi> then the <hi>Godhead</hi> is ſaid to dwell in Chriſt <hi>bodily,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>ſhadowes.</hi> Under the law, the <hi>body</hi> dwelt figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in the <hi>Ark;</hi> and, <hi>thence the glory of the Lord filled the houſe.</hi> But now it dwelleth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of all thoſe <hi>ſhadowes;</hi> It dwells in him <hi>bodily:</hi> Or if ye take <hi>body,</hi> as it ſometimes ſignifieth, <hi>perſon,</hi> The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> were wont to put the <hi>ſoul</hi> for the whole <hi>perſon; ſo many ſouls went down with Jacob into Egypt.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> were <note place="margin">Gen. 46. 27.</note> wont to put <hi>body</hi> for the <hi>whole perſon.</hi> I <hi>beſeech you, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by the mercies of God, preſent your bodies as a living ſacrifice;</hi> ſo then, <hi>to dwell bodily,</hi> is, <hi>to dwell perſonally.</hi> Now the <hi>fulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> dwells <hi>perſonally</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he was the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity; The Son of God, as full of the Divinity, as the Father himſelfe was.

Now indeeed it was neceſſary, there ſhould be a <hi>fulneſſe of ſufficiency in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> he had three great <hi>Offices</hi> to diſcharge, and every one of them requireth a <hi>fulneſſe;</hi> without which, he could not have gone through with his work: Accordingly, ye ſhall find <note place="margin">A three-fold fulneſſe in Chriſt, as to his Offices.</note> a <hi>fulneſſe of power in Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>King;</hi> a <hi>fulneſſe of wiſdom in Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Prophet;</hi> and a <hi>fulneſſe of righteouſneſſe in Chriſt,</hi> as he was the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of his Church; which three make up the <hi>fulneſſe of Sufficiency.</hi>

Therefore go preach: I am with you.</hi> And as all power in heaven and earth is given to Chriſt, as King of the Church; ſo, <hi>all power</hi> in <hi>Hell.</hi> Ye have an expreſſion that may, haply, bear this ſenſe, Rev. 1. 18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold I am alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen. And have the keys of hell, and of death.</hi> Chriſt hath the keyes of hell, and can ſend whom he will thither, and keep whom he will from thence. The Keys argue <hi>Power:</hi> It is a metaphor taken from Conquerors; when they take a City, they have the Keys thereof delivered into their hands, in token the City is now at their command. If <hi>Hell</hi> be here taken for the <hi>Grave,</hi> yet there be other places that ſhew, that Chriſt hath power over the Devills of hell: <hi>That at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in</hi>

                  <p>There is in Chriſt, as he is the Prophet of his Church, <note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>favour</hi> Chriſt grew, and ſo he might grow in <hi>experimentall knowledge</hi> too. What if a man might ſay, The <hi>habits</hi> of this <hi>created knowledge</hi> were enlarged in Chriſt, becauſe as Chriſt grew in years, the <hi>Human Nature</hi> grew in a capacity of more and more knowledge; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, there might be an enlargement in that ſenſe. If a man cut his name in ſmall letters in the bark of a tree, they are but ſmall at the firſt; as the tree growes, the letters grow; and when the tree commeth to the full grouth, the letters ſtand at a ſtay too. Thus, the <hi>Human Nature</hi> of Chriſt was extended, as he grew in Nature. But this we are ſure of, <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> as he was a <hi>Prophet.</hi>

He that hath leaſt, hath his proportion, and a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his degree. That which is hardly a fulneſſe, if ye compare him to any unregenerate man, his parts perhaps are beyond his. <hi>They ſhall all know me, from the leaſt, to the greateſt; I write to you little Children,</hi> (ſaith <hi>John) becauſe ye have known the Father,</hi> even the leaſt of God's people know him. Whereas the greateſt Schollar in the World, if he hath not entertained Chriſt, knoweth him not. There is a <hi>fulneſſe in Chriſt,</hi> though little; in compariſon whereof, the greateſt Schollars in the World, are but <hi>empty</hi> men. He knoweth Chriſt, as a man knoweth Hony, that hath taſted it, which is another kind of knowledge, than he hath that hath onely heard of it, and diſcourſed of it, and never taſted of it in his Life.</p>
                  <p>Again, There is a <hi>fulneſs of the fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi>

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:168769:141"/> They do not follow Chriſt by halfes; Chriſt a little, and the World much; but follow him fully, cloſe with him, even as two plain <hi>Superficies.</hi> Suppoſe two pieces of boards ſmoothed and plained, they cloſe one with another in every part; Whereas, a round thing doth cloſe onely in ſome one point, if ye put it to a thing that is plain. If ye lay a round ball upon a ſmooth Table, the ball cloſeth to the Table, but it is but in a point. Ye have falſe-hearted men, that ſeem to cloſe with God, and Chriſt; but it is in this, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular opinion, that may ſtand with their gain. Whereas the poor ſoul that followeth God, and Chriſt, followeth him fully in every truth, and every particular thing, that makes for God, and Chriſt; ſo there is a fulneſſe of obedience, as well as a fulneſſe of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Again, There is a <hi>fulneſs of joy;</hi> This <hi>Chriſt</hi> giveth, <note place="margin">5. In the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of joy.</note> where he communicateth <hi>himſelfe.</hi> He ſpeaks of it, Joh. 16. 24. <hi>Hitherto, have ye asked nothing in my Name, aske, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> They are but <hi>empty joyes,</hi> that the <hi>World</hi> giveth to its followers; Chriſt promiſeth a full joy to them, that ſeek to him. Therefore it is, that the members of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have a full joy, becauſe they have Communion with him, as their <hi>Head;</hi> He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, as in the inward man, and, <hi>In his preſence, is fulneſs of joy.</hi> Joy ariſeth from the fruition of ſome good thing, which a man knoweth, and knoweth himſelfe to have intereſt in. What ſo good, as Chriſt, who is the chiefeſt Good? when a poor believer comes to know Chriſt, and to be able to ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> Hence <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 16.</note> ariſeth a full joy, becauſe it is a joy in Chriſt, who is a good, a preſent good, a preſent known good, a preſent known good which I have intereſt in; beſides thoſe good things which are to come, that farther fruition of Chriſt, which men ſhall have in another World. In compariſon, of which, <hi>Paul</hi> accounts himſelfe abſent from the Lord, while he is preſent with the World. Though themſelves be abſent, they are preſent to the eye of faith, which is the <hi>evidence of things not ſeen, the ſubſtance of things hoped for;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Hebr. 11. 1.</note> in theſe, they can rejoyce, with a full joy.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Matter of Invitation, to them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> that they would be perſwaded to come in upon this ground.</p>

This was <hi>Paul's</hi> caſe, as it was <hi>Moſes</hi> his caſe, when he was forty daies, and nights upon the Mount; he had none, but <hi>God</hi> alone with him, he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up no proviſion: There he was.

So well, as they could not indure to behold the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Countenance; How came <hi>Moſes</hi> to receive ſo much vigour upon the Mount, where he had no ſuſtenance? Why, he had <hi>God</hi> there, and in him all: This is the great fountain of Conſolation. It is a pleaſant thing for a man to

A <hi>believing ſoul</hi> may go to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and take his hands full, his heart full, as much as ever he ſtandeth in need of. It is the condition of many a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to be alwaies on the complaining hand, though it ought not to be ſo; for, <hi>Cheerfulneſs is an honour to Profesſion.</hi>

And That, ye may call a fulneſſe if ye will, but it will prove emptineſs in the iſſue. <hi>Solomon</hi> at laſt comes to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, Eccleſ. 1. 14. <hi>I have ſeen all the works under the Sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of ſpirit;</hi> that is, <hi>emptineſs,</hi> ſo the word ſignifieth. As empty the creatures are, even as Ciſterns that hold no water, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 13. What refreſhing can be had from a ciſtern, that hath no water in it, or but little? ay, but that little in the iſſue comes to nothing, they are broken Ciſterns, and all runs out of them, that ſeemeth to be put in broken Ciſterns, that can hold no water. There is a meer deluſion in all the creatures, they make fair promiſes; but when a man commeth to ſeek for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:168769:144"/> comfort in them, he is like a Traveller, that comes to a Well for water, and findeth nothing but aire there, and ſo cries out, It is an empty Well. I remember a ſtory of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis,</hi> that when ſhe did lie upon her death-bed, ſhe cauſed her Monument to be made, and this Verſe written upon her Tomb,</p>

                  <p>If any Prince ſtandeth in need of Treaſure, let him dig in this Sepulcher, and ſee what he can find there. Many years after, <hi>Darius</hi> paſſing by, and beholding the Inſcription, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Monument to be digged open, where, inſtead of a great deal of treaſure, he findeth another Inſcription to this purpoſe, <hi>Had'ſt thou not been extreamly covetous, thou wouldſt never have digged into this Tomb for nothing.</hi> And ſo indeed, the creature hath no ſatisfaction in it. A man comes, and thinks to find much, and he hath there nothing, but a ſad leſſon for himſelf, to carry away with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us no longer play the <hi>Prodigall,</hi> ſeeing there is bread in our Father's houſe, let us not go to feed upon husks; the creatures are no better. All is vanity, and worſe; they are not onely vanity, but vexation of ſpirit, which ariſeth from the diſappointment of a man's hopes, when a man is vexed, when he is fruſtrated; looks for much, and finds a little. That is his caſe here, a man looks for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and findeth trouble. As our Saviour, in the daies of his fleſh, it is ſaid, <hi>He went to the fig-tree expecting</hi>

                     <hi>fruit, and found none;</hi> therefore he was provoked, and curſed the tree. Many a one leaves the creature with a curſe; which he ſought after with expectation of ſatisfaction from it. Oh! it is a curſed preferment, and pleaſure, ſaith he, even of that very thing, which he thought would have fully ſatisfied his ſoul, when he firſt enjoyed it. But now, this <hi>fulneſs of Chriſt</hi> is ſuch, as there is no vanity in it, no vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from it: nay, ſo far is it from vexation, that it giveth ſatisfaction which nothing elſe can give. Pſal. 36. 8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſſe of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them to drink of the rivers of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> For vexation in the one, here is ſatisfaction in the other; and for thoſe drops of pleaſure which men find in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168769:144"/> the creature, here is rivers of pleaſure, ſuch are thoſe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joyes that are in Chriſt. For the pleaſures of the creature, here are Rivers, every man may have his fill. If it were a Ciſtern, an Army might come and empty that. But here is enough, therefore I need not to envy another's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; there is enough for all that come to Chriſt.

For inſtance; It may be, thou art a better <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> in the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then ſuch a one; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, he was begotten into the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before thee, that is his honour. <hi>Paul</hi> accounted it the honour of ſome <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> that they were in Chriſt before him, and had got the ſtart of him in that, Rom. 16. 7. <hi>Salute Andronicus, and Junia my Kinſmen, and my fellow Priſoners, who are of note amongſt the Apoſtles, who alſo were in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> He valued them in that reſpect, though he was a Chriſtian of greater parts; yet they were in Chriſt before him, therefore, he durſt not contemn them. It may be, thou haſt been in Chriſt, before ſuch a one, yet the party may live more upon Chriſt, ſince he was in him, then thou haſt done. Thou haſt a greater ſtock of <hi>habituall grace;</hi> but he is a better Husband, with that little ſtock, he hath. It may be, thou art as <hi>aboundant</hi> in pains, as he, but God hath given him better ſucceſſe, then to thee; in his pains, that ſo thou maiſt have ſomething ſtill to value this labour. For, It may be, thou haſt more <hi>aſſurance</hi> then ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath, it is that, that puffeth thee up; but ſtay: It
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:168769:146"/> may be he, whom thou contemneſt, may have as much of <hi>faith,</hi> as thou haſt of <hi>aſſurance.</hi> That is no <hi>paradox.</hi> It is poſſible, one of leſſe degree of <hi>faith,</hi> may have a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>aſſurance</hi> for the preſent, becauſe <hi>aſſurance</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not upon the degree of <hi>believing;</hi> but upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>diſcovered light:</hi> God may come in betimes, with <hi>diſcovered light</hi> to one, that hath leſſe <hi>habituall grace. We have received the ſpirit, not of the Law, but of God, by which we know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Therefore, aſſurance depends upon the <hi>light,</hi> not upon the <hi>grace.</hi>

If Chriſt giveth a gift, it is to ſome end; And what is the end? why, improvement, ſo ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the ſpirit, is given to every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withall;</hi> that is, every Chriſtian Man, and Woman, hath ſomething in Him, or her, which manifeſteth their, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpirit of God. Therefore it is called, <hi>the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the ſpirit;</hi> And ſaid to be <hi>given to every man:</hi> but here is the end, <hi>to profit withall.</hi> What Talents a man hath received, he muſt not hide in a Napkin; As it is in the naturall body, That which every member receiveth, it is for the good of the whole. The <hi>ſtomack</hi> that takes in meat, but not for it ſelfe alone, but to nouriſh the <hi>body;</hi> The <hi>feet</hi> they move, too and from, not for themſelves alone, but to carry the <hi>body.</hi> The <hi>hand</hi> that worketh, not for it ſelfe alone, but to maintain the <hi>body;</hi> And ſo it is in the <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> telleth you clearly, 1 Pet. 4. 7. <hi>As every man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> Here is <hi>manifold grace;</hi> And ſo diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as every man hath received a <hi>gift,</hi> and <hi>as a good ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi> The <hi>ſteward</hi> receiveth the money, that is put into his hand, not to put up into his owne purſe, but for the good of the whole <hi>family;</hi> Men have received, that they may diſpence. Therefore, I ſay, ſeeing we all have received,

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:168769:147"/> that aſcribe ſomething to the creature, and ſomething to themſelves, that they have not received of free grace. There is a great deal of difference between <hi>habit acquired,</hi> and <hi>habit infuſed.</hi> Men ſpeak of <hi>grace,</hi> as if it were an <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red habit;</hi> and ſo aſcribe much to themſelves, and do not take all as received. Indeed, in <hi>acquired habits,</hi> the actions well performed, have a kind of <hi>caſualty</hi> in them; as, if a man learneth to write, his frequent <hi>habit</hi> bringeth him to write. But it is otherwiſe in <hi>infuſed habits;</hi> there, we have firſt the <hi>habit;</hi> then, perform the <hi>act:</hi> You have firſt the <hi>habit,</hi> that, we receive; then, the <hi>acts</hi> are produced; and, <hi>all is of God.</hi> As they ſay of the ſoul, Grace frames all of it ſelf; the free grace of God doth all in the ſoul, plants the <hi>habit,</hi> then draweth it forth into <hi>act,</hi> and then bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe <hi>acts,</hi> and then crowneth all. And what is the Crown? Why, his own work in us. God crowneth nothing in us, but what he giveth us. It is ſo from firſt to laſt, <hi>All is grace.</hi> Therefore there is no <hi>boaſting.</hi> Away then with proud opinions, and glorying of our ſelves in our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The truth is, this corruption of nature, though it vent it ſelf much in opinion, yet more in practiſe. It is too common a fault for men to play the <hi>Swan,</hi> when they look into the <hi>whiteneſs</hi> of their own <hi>boſoms,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>blackneſs</hi> of their <hi>feet.</hi> Whence is that <hi>white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> received, if there be any <hi>whiteneſs?</hi> It is from God; therefore glory not, as if thou hadſt not received. Yet, glory in God, but not in thy ſelf. There is that which will make us to play the <hi>Judas</hi> with <hi>Chriſt; Chriſt</hi> giveth a bag to <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> will filch from <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> giveth us grace, and we are apt to pocket up all for our ſelves. We derive all from Chriſt, and yet many times we take upon us, as if we had it out of our own <hi>Ciſterns: This I did, and ſaid; and this was done by my endeavours.</hi> Oh! <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> The Moon receiveth all its light from the Sun, and yet the Moon eclipſeth the Sun as much as in her lyeth. Seeing we receive all from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> let him have thé praiſe of all we have, and hope for. Let this break the pride of our hearts. Beggars muſt be no boaſters. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received, even grace for grace.</hi>

                  </label> Chriſt, and we, are to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>different ends.</hi> Indeed, there would be ſome ſtrength in the Reaſon, if we ſhould affirm, we are to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> to the ſame <hi>end,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> obſerved it; We obſerve the <hi>Law,</hi> to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our thankfulneſſe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the ſalvation we have by him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> obey'd the <hi>Law,</hi> to teſtifie obedience for us; Therefore, we are bound to obey ſo much the more, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> obeyed it.

                  <hi>ing this, that the Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſſe, and diſobedient, for the ungodly, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Therefore a perſon juſtified, ſaith the <hi>Objector,</hi> hath nothing to do with the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the meaning of this place, take it clearly thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Ye cannot underſtand this place <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as if, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> whoſoever is righteous, had nothing to do with the <hi>Law;</hi> for, ye know, <hi>Adam,</hi> in his Innocency, had a <hi>Law</hi> given him. This therefore cannot be denyed: Look how far a man is righteous, he hath a principle within him, that even without a Law it will conſtrain him to obey: <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> As far as a man <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> walks according to this principle, ſo far he doth not come within the compaſſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> as to the <hi>penalty</hi> of it. A Law, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it doth not lye againſt a righteous man. That is the <hi>property</hi> of the word. As when it is ſaid, <hi>The ax is laid</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the root of the tree,</hi> to cut it down. The <hi>Law</hi> is not laid to a righteous man, to condemn him. As we ſay in Suits at Law, A Suit lyeth againſt ſuch a man, in ſuch a Court; that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> in this ſenſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth not lye againſt a righteous man. If ye will have the clear meaning of this, ſee Gal. 5. 23. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, meekneſs. Againſt ſuch there is no law.</hi> Make up the meaning betwixt theſe two, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 23. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man.</hi> That is, Made to direct him, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him.</p>
               <p>Then, to have done with this, There is no ſuch great cauſe why the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be afraid of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Law,</hi> in their Sermons: So long as we preach the <hi>Law</hi> with the ſame intent that God gave it, we may preach it without fear.</p>
               <p>God gave the <hi>Law</hi> with a double ſubſerviency. Before our Converſion, the <hi>Law</hi> is ſubſervient to lead a man to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and after our Converſion, the <hi>Law</hi> is ſubſervient to direct us in the way to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God gave the <hi>Law</hi> for <note place="margin">The Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical ends.</note> 
                  <hi>Evangelicall</hi> ends, and men ſhould preach the <hi>Law</hi> for <hi>Evangelicall</hi> ends; not to ſet up a covenant of Works, but
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:168769:150"/> to drive them out of themſelves to Chriſt; and then, when they are in Chriſt, to help to guid them in the way of <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> To preach the <hi>Law</hi> as Chriſt himſelf preached it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. who ſpent a great part of that Sermon in the Mount, upon the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then for People, as well as for Preachers; they need not fear having reſpect to the <hi>Law. David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſhall not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect to all thy commandments.</hi> Some ſeem to be aſhamed, to have reſpect to any of the commandments of God. Certainly, Brethren, if ye will obey the <hi>Law</hi> out of <hi>Evangelicall</hi> principles, as it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for <hi>Evangelicall</hi> ends, you need never to be afraid of obſerving it. They are the ſame <hi>precepts</hi> to a man converted, but they are obſerved out of new <hi>principles;</hi> yet the <hi>precepts</hi> continue the ſame. <hi>Heſt.</hi> 2. 10. it is ſaid, that <hi>ſhe had not yet ſhewed her kindred and people, as Mordechai had charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, that ſhe ſhould not ſhew it.</hi> She was obedient to <hi>Mordechai,</hi> all the while ſhe had been under his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when ſhe was <hi>Queen,</hi> yet ſtill ſhe doth the commandment of <hi>Mordechai.</hi> When men are ingraffed into <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they are ſtill bound to do the commandments of the <hi>Law,</hi> as before: then they were bound under the curſe of it, for fear; but now out of love. Here the grace of Chriſt will make them more obedient, becauſe it <hi>teacheth them to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts.</hi> I have done with this. Now to the next Verſe, which runneth thus,</p>

No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> (no, not <hi>Moſes) but the onely begotten Son.

Numb. 12. 8. <hi>With him will I ſpeak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark ſpeeches; and the ſimilitude of the Lord ſhall he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.

               <p> I dare not exclude neither of theſe, in reference to the Text, becauſe the words which follow ſeem to have Chriſt in both, <hi>The onely begotten Son which is in the boſom of the</hi>

The <hi>Second Perſon in the Trinity,</hi> before he took the nature of man, took the ſhape of man; ſuch a ſhape had <hi>Chriſt</hi> taken here, in which he wreſtled with <hi>Jacob;</hi> and this is that <hi>God</hi> which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw face to face, not <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> in a <hi>repreſentation.</hi> And that very thing of <hi>God,</hi> appearing in the Old Teſtament in a <hi>repreſentation,</hi> to the eyes of the body, ſheweth, that he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:168769:152"/> never appeared to them in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> becauſe his <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> are <hi>many,</hi> and his <hi>eſſence</hi> is <hi>one.</hi> He appeared in a Buſh to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to <hi>Eliah</hi> in a ſtill Voice; to <hi>Jacob</hi> as a Wreſtler, to <hi>Joſhua</hi> as a Captain of the Lord's hoaſt. Theſe were all <hi>repreſentations,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed to make of himſelf; and thus men ſaw him. But his <hi>eſſence</hi> all this while was inviſible, neither could it be diverſified as his <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> were, being but <hi>one.</hi> That is memorable which <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſaith, Iſa. 6. 5. <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of hoſts.</hi> The Jews took this advantage againſt him, and ſaid, he was a falſe Prophet; Why? He ſaid, he <hi>had ſeen the King, the Lord of hoaſts;</hi> whereas God ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Thou canſt not ſee my face and live.</hi> Therefore they put him to death. No man can ſee <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> and live. But <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaw him, and he ſaid true; but it was in a <hi>repreſentation</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, No man can ſee <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> no, not by the eye of <hi>Reaſon. Reaſon</hi> hath but three waies, by which it <note place="margin">2. The eye of our Reaſon cannot behold him in his Eſſence. Reaſon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God three waies. 1. By way of Cauſality.</note> comes to the knowledge of God, and thoſe are known to <hi>Schollars</hi> by theſe names, <hi>Via cauſalitatis, via Remotionis,</hi> and <hi>via Eminentiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of <hi>Cauſality;</hi> and ſo reaſon comes to gather of <hi>God</hi> by all the creatures which it ſeeth lovely; and looks at all theſe as effects of <hi>God,</hi> as the cauſe of all, and ſo comes to the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>firſt cauſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Reaſon</hi> collects of <hi>God:</hi> But how far is this from ſeeing the <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>God? Reaſon</hi> diſcovers a <hi>God,</hi> but not what <hi>God</hi> is in his <hi>Beeing,</hi> onely that <hi>He is.</hi> For, no <hi>effect</hi> can ſhew the nature of its <hi>cauſe</hi> fully, but either ſuch as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth the whole force of the cauſe, or elſe ſuch as is of the ſame kind with the cauſe; as burning, that ſheweth the nature of the fire, becauſe the fire, being a naturall agent, burns to the utmoſt of its power. Therefore burning ſheweth what nature the fire is of, as carrying the nature of the force in it. As a child ſheweth the nature of the father, becauſe of the ſame nature with the father. But the <hi>creatures</hi> cannot ſhew <hi>God,</hi> becauſe they are of <hi>effects</hi> different from him. Theſe are parts of the way, but how little proportion is readd of him? <hi>The thunder of his power, who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand?</hi> Neither are the <hi>creatures</hi> of the ſame rank and kind
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:168769:153"/> with <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>child</hi> is with the <hi>father;</hi> they are all of them <hi>finite,</hi> God is <hi>infinite.</hi> So that all that Reaſon can do this way, is, to gather, that there is a <hi>God,</hi> but not what he is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is the way of <hi>Remotion,</hi> by looking over <note place="margin">2. By way of Remotion.</note> all the creatures, and by ſetting aſide whatſoever ſavours of imperfection in them, and aſcribing the remainder to <hi>God.</hi> Thus we ſay, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Immortall, Impaſſible, Impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable;</hi> becauſe we ſay, that to <hi>die,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> and to <hi>ſin,</hi> are the <hi>imperfections</hi> of the <hi>creature.</hi> God cannot ſin, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die, God cannot lie, God cannot ſuffer. But this ſtill comes ſhort of ſeeing <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence;</hi> for, by this, we ſee what <hi>God</hi> is not, not what he is, by this way of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third way, which is a way of <hi>Eminency. Reaſon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3. By way of Eminency.</note> goeth over the <hi>creatures</hi> once again, and looks whatſoever is good in them, and ſavours of perfection in them; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes that to <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Author</hi> of thoſe perfections. So, when it ſeeth in <hi>Man, wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe; Reaſon</hi> can aſcribe to <hi>God</hi> (as the cauſe of them) a more <hi>eminent goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength.</hi> And this is the neareſt, and the fartheſt, <hi>Reaſon</hi> can go. And yet in all theſe, it cometh ſhort of the <hi>eſſence of God;</hi> becauſe in this way, it findeth out what he is, rather in regard of his <hi>qualities,</hi> (ſpeaking after the manner of men) then what he is in his <hi>eſſence.</hi> Thus we cannot ſee <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> no not by the eye of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is onely one more, that is, the <hi>eye of Faith,</hi> which <note place="margin">

                     </gap>. The eye of Faith cannot apprehend God in his Eſſence.</note> goeth a great deal further into the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> than <hi>Reaſon</hi> can; and yet we cannot apprehend <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>eſſence,</hi> no not by the <hi>eye of Faith.</hi> Thence it is, that faith is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſight, 2 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>We walk by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> Implying, that all the while we have no higher prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple than faith in us, all that while we come ſhort of <hi>God,</hi> to ſee him face to face. 1 Cor. 13. 12. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face. Then,</hi> ſpeaking of a time after this life, <hi>when that which is perfect is come, and that which is imperfect ſhall be done away;</hi> Then, face to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:168769:153"/> face, not till then. Here, by the eye of <hi>faith,</hi> we ſee as through a glaſſe darkly; Theſe are two excellent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though ſomething darkned by the <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> For it is, as through a glaſſe, &amp; in a riddle; here is the glaſſe to the eye, and the riddle to the eare; both imply, that faith gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us but a dark knowledge of God, in compariſon of the light of glory. What we ſee in a <hi>glaſſe,</hi> we ſee by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection;</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> ſee <hi>God</hi> face to face, by direct beams. We ſee him as in a glaſſe, the glaſſe of the Creatures, and of the Scriptures; There ſhall be no need of theſe glaſſes in Heaven, where all Ordinances ſhall ceaſe, and God ſhall be all, in all. But here, as through a glaſſe, and as in a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. What men apprehend in a riddle, they may have true apprehenſions of it; As in the <hi>riddle,</hi> that <hi>Sampſon</hi> put <note place="margin">Judges 14. 14.</note> forth. But it doth not convey a thing ſo clearly, as if it were ſpoken in plain words; Whatſoever we ſee, we ſee it, as in a <hi>glaſſe.</hi> Whatſoever we hear, we hear, as in a <hi>riddle;</hi> but then, <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> then we ſhall ſee him, as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> So now, ye have had an explication of this propoſition, according to the firſt ſenſe; <hi>That no man hath ſeen God at any time.</hi> That is, <hi>No man, in the ſtate of mortality, hath a beatificall viſion of God in his Eſſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I proceed now to the ſecond. That, <hi>No man here, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth</hi>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:168769:154"/> which he hath opened through his owne fleſh, to the way of Heaven.

Not conſidering what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, Job 33. 12, 13. <hi>Behold, in this thou art not juſt, I will anſwer thee, That God is greater then man; why doeſt thou ſtrive againſt him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</hi>

Therefore, it is good to take the counſell of <hi>Auguſtine; Vis tu diſputare mecum?

Men that take upon them to ſtate the <hi>Decrees of God,</hi> as if they had been of his <hi>Councill,</hi> when he made them; men that ſeem to wade where <hi>Paul</hi> was paſt his <hi>depth,</hi> which made him cry, <hi>O the depth!</hi> They make it clear to you, to give you a reaſon of all God's <hi>Decrees,</hi> if you take for granted what they ſay. If you ask them, Why <hi>Peter</hi> was elected, and <hi>Judas</hi> not? they ſay, Becauſe God foreſaw <hi>Peter</hi> would believe, and <hi>Judas</hi> not. Why <hi>Peter</hi> was ſaved, and <hi>Judas</hi> not? Becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> willed to perſevere in ſin, and <hi>Peter</hi> did not. Are not here men of God's <hi>Council,</hi> that leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unſearched? Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was diſcourſing of theſe high points, Rom. 9. 13, 14. <hi>It is written, Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated. What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid.</hi> He ſpeaketh as a man puzl'd and non-pluſſed at the thoughts of this, how God ſhould come to chuſe <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hate <hi>Eſau.</hi> He ſaw no unrighteouſneſſe with God; God hath done it, and therefore <hi>Juſt.</hi> And yet theſe people ſpeak, as if they could have fetched <hi>Paul</hi> out of his <hi>non-plus,</hi> which is but to ſay, That God foreſaw that <hi>Jacob</hi> would believe, and <hi>Eſau</hi> would not; therefore he loved the one, and hated the other. So as a man; according to this reckoning, may learn more in <hi>Arminius</hi> his <hi>School</hi> in a few daies, then <hi>Paul</hi> had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>third heavens.</hi> Let us take this for a concluſion: As God cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Firſt, It implyeth <hi>unity of Natures;</hi> and ſo there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">1. To be in the boſome of the Father, implyeth uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Natures</note> more in <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Thus the boſome is the child's place. Look to the Scripture-expreſſions.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:168769:157"/> ſo accordingly here, <hi>The onely begotten Son, that is in the boſome of the Father,</hi> to ſhew the <hi>unity of Natures</hi> that is between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son; Chriſt</hi> being <hi>God,</hi> co-equall with the <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it implyeth <hi>unity of Natures,</hi> ſo it implyeth <note place="margin">2. It implyeth dearneſſe of Affection.</note> 
                     <hi>dearneſſe of Affection. Boſom,</hi> as it is for <hi>children,</hi> ſo for <hi>nearneſs of Relation.

In this ſenſe, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Father's boſome,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Father's love. He ſhall tranſlate us into the kingdom of the Son of his love. This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> ſaith the Voice from heaven. <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Being in the <hi>boſome,</hi> implyeth <hi>communication</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. It implyeth communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Secrets.</note> 
                     <hi>of Secrets;</hi> the <hi>boſome</hi> is a place for them. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Tully</hi> to a friend, that had betruſted him with a ſecret, <hi>Crede mihi, &amp;c.</hi> Believe me, ſaith he, what thou haſt committed to me, it is in my <hi>boſome</hi> ſtill, I am not ungirt, to let it ſlip out. But Scripture addeth this hint too, where it ſpeaketh of the <hi>boſome</hi> as the place of Secrets, Prov. 17. 23. <hi>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome, to pervert the waies of judgment,</hi> ſpeaking of a bribe. Prov. 21. 14. <hi>A gift in ſecret pacifieth anger, and a reward in the boſome expiateth wrath.</hi> Here is <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>boſome</hi> all one, as <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> are one. So, <hi>Chriſt lyeth in the Father's boſome;</hi> this intimateth his being conſcious to all the Father's ſecrets. So have ye an opening of this phraſe. Much is to be learned from it. <note place="margin">1. Give the ſame Worſhip to Chriſt as to the Father.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Seeing Chriſt's being in the <hi>boſome</hi> of the Father implyeth <hi>unity of natures,</hi> this ſhould teach us to give the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168769:157"/> ſame worſhip to Chriſt, as we give to the Father, becauſe there is the <hi>ſame nature</hi> in both. It is that, that Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth and calleth for, Joh. 5. 23. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father which hath ſent him. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> requireth the ſame honour, which we give to <hi>God the Father;</hi> it is fit he ſhould have it, and it is fit this honour ſhould be pleaded for, now in this age, wherein many plead againſt the <hi>Divinity of Chriſt.</hi> We ſhould give him the ſame honour that we give to the Father. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>When he bringeth him in as the firſt-born of the world, he ſaith, Let all the Angels in heaven worſhip him.</hi> If they, then how ought all the world to worſhip him? We ſhould give him the honour of <hi>Invocation,</hi> praying to him, as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, when they ſtoned him; he called upon God, and ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> As with <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and <hi>Invocation,</hi> ſo with <hi>Faith.</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham gave glory to God, by believing in him.</hi> We ſhould give honour to Chriſt, by exerciſing the act of believing in him; this he called for, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled; ye</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 1. Chriſt the proper object of Faith.</note> 
                     <hi>believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> He is the proper object of faith, as he juſtifieth. <hi>Circumferentia fidei eſt Verbum Dei, ſed Centrum eſt Deus.</hi> The whole Word of God is the circumference of faith; every thing learned in it, is to be believed: But the center of faith (as the <hi>Word</hi> juſtifieth) that, is the Word, <hi>God;</hi> that, is Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His being in the boſome of the Father, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth <note place="margin">2. It teacheth us to ſet our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt.</note> the <hi>dearneſſe of affection,</hi> between the Father, and the Son. And this teacheth us (who are bound to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God, as dear children) to ſet our affections upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe God doth ſo; He, who is the <hi>Son</hi> of God's love, ſhould be the <hi>object</hi> of our love. God hath a <hi>boſome</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we ſhould have a <hi>boſome</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> too; It is ſaid of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that, after his death, his body being opened, the name <hi>Jeſus</hi> was found written in his heart. That is a <hi>fable,</hi> yet hath a good <hi>morall;</hi> every ſoul ſhould have <hi>Jeſus</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:168769:158"/> written in the heart; becauſe the love of the heart ſhould be beſtowed upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>nobleſt object,</hi> and beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it.</p>
                  <p>Again, ye have an expreſſion that comes home, to that in the Text, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13. (ye ſhall ſee where the Church laid <hi>Chriſt;) A bundle of myrrhe, is my well-beloved to me, He ſhall lie all night between my breaſts.</hi> Here the <hi>Church</hi> maketh a room for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to lie in her <hi>boſome;</hi> This is a moſt <hi>ſignificant</hi> expreſſion, This comparing Chriſt to a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>myrrhe,</hi> which is of a bitter taſt, but a ſweet ſmell. And ſo, fitter to repreſent Chriſt Crucified; in whoſe death, there was a concurrence of theſe two, <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Nothing ſo bitter in it ſelf, as the <hi>paſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the token of which, was the <hi>paſchall Lamb,</hi> which was to be eaten with <hi>bitter herbs.</hi> He indured more, then we can comprehend; His owne ſoul onely, could know that bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As there was a great deal of <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> in it, ſo a great deal of <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> too, as in <hi>myrrhe; He offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to God a ſacrifice, of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 2. ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle. Myrrhe,</hi> they ſay, is of ſpeciall uſe to keep from putrefaction, to dry up moiſt humours; therefore, they took <hi>myrrhe</hi> to inbalm <hi>Chriſt's body</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; And ſuch drieth up the ſuperfluous humours of the ſoul. As <hi>Phyſitians</hi> ſay, That in nature, a bundle of <hi>myrrhe</hi> between the breaſts is <hi>Cordiall;</hi> ſurely, we have no ſuch Cordialls as <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the boſome. Therefore, <hi>A bundle of myrrhe my beloved is to me, He ſhall lie all night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my breaſts;</hi> Nothing ſo bitter as my ſins were, but the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and yet nothing ſo ſweet, as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was crucified for my ſins, to take them away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us find a <hi>boſome</hi> to lay Chriſt in, for the time to come; If we will be glad of his <hi>boſome,</hi> when we die. He will be content to lie in ours now, if we will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; Certainly, it concerneth us to know what we do with our affections: How we beſtow our love. Loe, here is an <hi>object,</hi> to be beloved, more then the <hi>wife</hi> of the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> more then the <hi>husband</hi> of the <hi>boſome;</hi> Here is the <hi>Mediator</hi> in the <hi>boſome.</hi> If any thing will draw-out love
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:168769:158"/> from us, it is the conſideration of that love, which he hath ſhewed to us; <hi>Love is the Load-ſtone of love.</hi> See how he <note place="margin">Amor magnes amoris.</note> hath opened his boſome to us, how he hath exceeded all the patterns of love; We find in Scripture, <hi>Rebecca</hi> loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> better then <hi>Eſau;</hi> Therefore, ſhe put him into a way of getting the bleſſing. And when <hi>Jacob</hi> was afraid of the event, leſt his father ſhould curſe him, <hi>The curſe be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>upon me my ſon,</hi> ſaith ſhe; The Lord putteth us into a way of getting an <hi>eternall bleſſing</hi> from God the <hi>Father,</hi> and for the procuring of this, he himſelfe is become a <hi>curſe</hi> for us. <hi>He was made ſin for us, and a curſe, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> better then <hi>Leah;</hi> therefore, was content to ſerve ſo many years. For us, the Lord took upon him the form of a ſervant, and in that form ſerved for us three and thirty years, and more, here in the fleſh. <hi>Jonathan</hi> loved <hi>David,</hi> and, to manifeſt his love, he put his owne garment upon him; <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo loved us, as to cloath us with his owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> and therefore ſet him at his owne Table, to eate bread continually, though he were <hi>lame. Chriſt</hi> ſo loveth us, notwithſtanding all our <hi>lameneſſe,</hi> and <hi>imperfections,</hi> as to provide a Table for us, where we ſhall one day ſit <hi>down with Iſaac, and Jacob, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</hi> Beloved, do you provide a room for Chriſt in <hi>your boſomes;</hi> and he will provide a room for you <hi>in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams boſome,</hi> yea, <hi>in his owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This being in the Fathers <hi>boſome,</hi> implieth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. It teacheth us to go to Chriſt for illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</note>

                  <head>He hath declared him.</head>
                  <p>You have heard of a two-fold ſight of God, a Beatificall, and Scientificall viſion.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>A Beatificall Viſion, in Reference to his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>A Scientificall Viſion, in Reference to his Counſell.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And that Chriſt, the onely begotten Son, may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from either of theſe; the next Clauſe implieth, <hi>Which is in the boſome of his Father.</hi> I ſay, It implieth, That Chriſt the Son hath a beatificall viſion of God the Father, even in his eſſence; here, while upon the face of the earth, amongſt the Children of men. And beſides this, He muſt needs ſee the eſſence of God, that is, eſſentially, God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>And His lying in the boſome of the Father, implieth, That he could not but have the ſcientificall viſion of the Father; Hence we inferre, that none is fitter, to declare the Father, then he that ſaw the Father, and none more able to ſhew forth the mind and the Counſell of the Father, then he that lay in the Father's boſome.</p>

And it is properly to be applied, to Divine and Heavenly Myſteries; Hence there ariſeth a difference between <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>So then, Concerning the diſcovery of the Father by Chriſt, two things are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, The perſon declaring, <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Secondly, The perſon declared, <hi>the Father.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>perſon declaring.</hi> From hence note two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>The Fitneſſe of the Meſſenger.</item>
                     <item>The Fulneſſe of the Meſſage.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Firſt, The fitneſſe of the Meſſenger, by whom in theſe latter times, the deep myſteries of the Father's Divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and will, (ſo farre as is neceſſary to Salvation) is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. For Jeſus Chriſt the onely begotten Son of God, that lay in the boſome of the Father, who is the expreſſe Image of his Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. hath ſhewed to us the Inviſible glory, and made it viſible; ſo farre, as we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold it. An expreſſion you have to confirm this out of the mouth of Chriſt himſelfe, Matth. 11. 27. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whom ſoever the Son will reveal him,</hi> Joh. 6. 46. <hi>No man hath ſeen the Father, ſave he that is of God, he hath ſeen the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The fulneſſe of the Meſſage, that Chriſt hath declared, which is indeed, Every thing neceſſary for man's Salvation; and whatſoever Chriſt hath declared, is true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, wholeſome, and ſufficient. Therefore, no leaving the Word of Chriſt, and flying to human Traditions: for ſaith he, Joh. 3. 11. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, we ſpeak that we do know, and teſtifie that we have ſeen,</hi> And, Hebr. 1. 1. <hi>God, who at ſundry times, and in diverſe manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> The words in the originall are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by piece-meal, darkly, by riddles, and viſions formerly: but now, he hath
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:168769:160"/> clearly declared, not onely <hi>himſelfe,</hi> by his Son, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe (ſo much as our frail natures and weak capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities can reach unto) tending to the ſalvation of all the Elect of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The next thing is the <hi>Perſon declared,</hi> That is the <hi>Father,</hi> or the mind, and will of the Father, or, more plainly: Chriſt, that lay in the boſome of the Father, hath declared from the Father's boſome, the glorious myſtery of man's Redemption; his Juſtification by faith, and the way to everlaſting happineſſe, and glory.</p>
                  <p>I now go on to as brief an Application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Doth Chriſt declare the mind of the Father? get then Intimacy, and Familiarity with Jeſus Chriſt; Take Him into thy heart, that lay in the boſome of the Father. For what greater ſtay can we have in the time of trouble, and what more ſupporting Comfort and conſolation in the hour of Temptation, than to be acquainted with, and united to him, that is the Churches Head; and our Lord, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the onely begotten Son of God; and to lye in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take notice of the Dignity of a Chriſtian; that hath ſo able, and ſo gratious an Interpreter, even the Eternall Son of God. He it is, that to us declareth the will, and layeth open the whole Counſell of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let dignity oblige you to duty. If Jeſus Chriſt declareth the will of the Father: then, upon the life of your ſouls, it exceedingly much concerneth you diligently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and carefully to attend unto what Chriſt declareth; Learning alwayes to ſubmit to the will of the Father, thus declared by his Son, that his Name alone may be glorified, and our ſouls Eternally ſaved.</p>
